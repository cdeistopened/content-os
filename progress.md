# Content OS - Progress Log

## Session: 2026-02-02

**Breakthrough:** Simplified from "30 skills" to "one configurable writing engine."

**What Changed:**
- Started with inventory of 176 skills, proposed cutting to 30
- Realized the product isn't a skill library at all
- It's ONE system: Voice + Framework + Format

**The Product:**
```
Clone repo → Capture your voice → Pick format → Get output that sounds like you
```

**Files Updated:**
- task_plan.md - New phases reflecting simpler architecture
- findings.md - Architecture documented, kill list clarified
- progress.md - This file

**Next Session:**
1. Design voice capture workflow (what samples? what extraction?)
2. Curate framework library from existing templates
3. Define format options
4. Sketch the CLAUDE.md that ties it together

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Product scope | One engine, not many skills | Simpler, more powerful, easier to explain |
| Voice capture | 3-5 writing samples | Enough to extract patterns, not overwhelming |
| Separate tools | Only image gen, search, transcription | Different domains, can't be absorbed |

## Blockers

None.
