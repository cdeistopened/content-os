# Meta Ads Creative Skill

## Purpose

This skill creates Meta ad creative (Facebook/Instagram) that converts using **research-driven creative development**, the **6 Elements framework**, and **format fitting** - matching your message to proven ad formats that feel native to the feed.

**Core Philosophy:** The best Meta ads don't look like ads. They look like organic content that happens to have a compelling offer. Lo-fi > polished. Authentic > produced. Native > interruptive.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create ad creative for Meta (Facebook/Instagram) campaigns
- Develop ad concepts for retargeting or cold audiences
- Generate multiple ad variations for A/B testing
- Transform testimonials or content into ad creative
- Apply proven formats to new messaging

**Use in conjunction with:**
- `hook-and-headline-writing` - For optimizing Primary Text hooks
- `opened-identity` - For brand voice and messaging alignment
- `social-content-creation` - For organic content that can be boosted

**Do NOT use for:**
- Google/YouTube ads (different format requirements)
- Organic social posts (use `social-content-creation` instead)
- Email campaigns (different copywriting approach)

---

## The Meta Ads Value Formula

**Value = Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood / Time Delay × Effort**

Every ad must communicate:
1. **Dream Outcome** - What transformation do they want?
2. **Perceived Likelihood** - Will this actually work for them?
3. **Time Delay** - How long until they get results?
4. **Effort Required** - How hard is this to do?

**Maximize numerator (Dream Outcome × Likelihood), minimize denominator (Time × Effort).**

## The 6 Elements of Ad Creative

Every Meta ad has 6 elements. Master each one:

### 1. Media (The Visual)
The image or video that stops the scroll. This is 80% of performance.

**Media Types:**
- **Static Image:** Single photo or graphic
- **Video:** UGC, text-over-video, testimonial, demo
- **Carousel:** Multiple images/videos user swipes through
- **Slideshow:** Auto-playing image sequence

**Lo-Fi Media Principles:**
- iPhone footage > professional production
- Natural lighting > studio lighting
- Authentic settings > staged environments
- Faces and people > stock graphics
- Text overlays that look native > polished graphics

### 2. Primary Text (Above the Media)
The copy that appears above your media. This is your hook + body copy.

**Structure:**
```
[HOOK - 1-2 sentences that stop the scroll]

[BODY - Expand on the hook, build desire, address objections]

[BRIDGE - Connect to the offer/CTA]
```

**Character Limits:**
- First 125 characters show before "See More"
- Total: Up to 2,200 characters (but shorter often better)

### 3. Headline (Below the Media)
Short, punchy text below the image/video. Often the "promise."

**Best Practices:**
- 5-8 words maximum
- Clear benefit or outcome
- Curiosity or specificity works best
- Examples: "Homeschooling Made Possible" / "No-Cost Personalized Education"

### 4. Description (Below Headline)
Secondary text under headline. Often underutilized.

**Uses:**
- Deadline/urgency: "Apply for Fall 2025"
- Social proof: "Join 5,000+ families"
- Clarification: "No experience needed"
- Offer detail: "Free application, no commitment"

### 5. CTA Button
The action button. Choose from Meta's options:

**Best for Education/Programs:**
- "Learn More" - Low commitment, good for cold traffic
- "Apply Now" - Higher intent, good for warm/retargeted traffic
- "Sign Up" - For newsletter/lead magnet offers
- "Get Offer" - For specific promotions

### 6. Page (Landing Page)
Where users go when they click. Critical for conversion.

**Landing Page Principles:**
- Message match: Landing page headline should mirror ad
- Single CTA: Don't confuse with multiple options
- Mobile-first: 80%+ of Meta traffic is mobile
- Fast loading: Under 3 seconds

## The 4-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Research

**Goal:** Understand your audience's language, pain points, and desires before writing a single word.

#### Step 1: Customer Feedback Mining

**Sources:**
- Testimonials and reviews
- Support tickets and FAQs
- Sales call transcripts
- Survey responses

**What to extract:**
- Exact language they use to describe problems
- Specific outcomes they want (in their words)
- Objections and hesitations
- Emotional triggers (fear, frustration, hope)

**Example from OpenEd testimonials:**
> "I felt like I was giving him what he needed" → Parent's desire for personalized attention
> "We were drowning financially" → Financial stress as key pain point
> "He went from hating school to asking to do more" → Transformation story

#### Step 2: Reddit/Community Research

**Where to look:**
- r/homeschool
- r/education
- Facebook homeschool groups
- Parenting forums

**What to find:**
- Common questions asked
- Complaints about alternatives
- Success stories shared
- Advice given to newbies

**Research Output:**
Document 10-20 insights with exact quotes and source links.

#### Step 3: Competitor Ad Analysis

**Where to look:**
- Meta Ad Library (ads.facebook.com)
- Search competitors' brand names
- Look for ads running 30+ days (indicates performance)

**What to analyze:**
- Hook styles that get engagement
- Offers being made
- Ad formats used
- Messaging angles

#### Step 4: Organic Content Mining

**What performs:**
- Which organic posts get most engagement?
- What topics resonate?
- What formats work?

**Insight:** Top-performing organic content often makes great ad creative with minor modifications.

#### Step 5: Audience Segment Mapping

**OpenEd Primary Segments:**

| Segment | Pain Point | Dream Outcome | Message Angle |
|---------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| New-to-Homeschool | Overwhelmed, don't know where to start | Confidence and clarity | "Guidance + resources to get started" |
| Budget-Conscious | Can't afford curriculum/resources | Quality without financial stress | "Tuition-free access to premium resources" |
| Burned-Out Public School | Frustrated with system | Peace and engaged kids | "Education that actually fits your child" |
| Experienced Homeschooler | Time/resource optimization | More efficiency, less stress | "Support to level up your homeschool" |
| Special Needs Parent | Child not thriving in system | Child who loves learning | "Personalized approach for every learner" |
| Working Parent | Flexibility concerns | Education that fits schedule | "Flexible options for busy families" |

**Research Phase Output:**
Create file: `[Campaign]_Research.md` with all insights organized by source.

---

### Phase 2: Copywriting

**Goal:** Transform research insights into compelling ad copy using proven formulas.

#### Step 1: Identify Market Awareness Level

Your audience falls on a spectrum. Match your copy to their awareness:

**Level 1: Unaware**
- Don't know they have a problem
- Lead with problem/pain agitation
- Example: "Your child spends 7 hours a day in a system designed in 1892..."

**Level 2: Problem Aware**
- Know the problem, don't know solutions exist
- Agitate problem, introduce solution category
- Example: "Frustrated with traditional school? There's another way..."

**Level 3: Solution Aware**
- Know solutions exist, don't know your product
- Differentiate your approach
- Example: "Unlike other homeschool programs, OpenEd provides..."

**Level 4: Product Aware**
- Know your product, haven't bought
- Address objections, provide proof
- Example: "See why 5,000+ families chose OpenEd..."

**Level 5: Fully Aware**
- Know and want your product
- Make the offer irresistible
- Example: "Apply now - Fall 2025 spots filling fast"

**OpenEd Typical Audiences:**
- Cold traffic: Level 1-2 (Unaware to Problem Aware)
- Retargeted traffic: Level 3-4 (Solution to Product Aware)
- Email list: Level 4-5 (Product Aware to Fully Aware)

#### Step 2: Hook Selection

The hook is everything. 80% of ad performance comes from the first 1-3 seconds.

**Hook Types:**

**1. Stated Hook (What you SAY)**
- First 1-2 sentences of Primary Text
- Must create curiosity, emotion, or promise value

**2. Visual Hook (What they SEE)**
- First frame of video
- The image itself
- Text overlay on media

**3. Audio Hook (What they HEAR)**
- First 2-3 seconds of video audio
- Background music/sound
- Voice tone and energy

**Hook Formulas That Work:**

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "This is your sign..." | "This is your sign to finally start homeschooling" |
| "POV: It's [future date]..." | "POV: It's 2026 and you're crushing homeschool" |
| "Nobody talks about..." | "Nobody talks about the financial stress of homeschooling" |
| "I wish I knew..." | "I wish I knew this before we started homeschooling" |
| "The [X] Starter Pack" | "The Homeschool Mom Starter Pack" |
| "Stop [common behavior]" | "Stop spending thousands on curriculum" |
| "[X] people do this, [Y] people do that" | "Some moms stress about curriculum. Smart moms join OpenEd." |
| Question hooks | "What if homeschooling didn't cost a fortune?" |
| Statement + Contrarian | "Schools aren't failing. They're working exactly as designed." |

#### Step 3: Body Copy Formulas

**PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution)**
```
[State the problem]
[Make it worse - emotional consequences]
[Introduce solution]
```

**AIDA (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action)**
```
[Hook that grabs attention]
[Build interest with benefits/features]
[Create desire with outcomes/proof]
[Clear call to action]
```

**Before-After-Bridge**
```
[Before: Current painful state]
[After: Desired outcome achieved]
[Bridge: How to get there (your offer)]
```

**Testimonial Formula**
```
[Quote from real parent]
[Their specific outcome]
[How OpenEd helped]
[Invitation to experience same]
```

#### Step 4: Write Multiple Variations

**Generate Volume:**
- Write 5-10 Primary Text variations per concept
- Test different hooks, body structures, lengths
- Vary emotional angle (fear vs hope, urgency vs aspiration)

**Copywriting Output:**
Create file: `[Campaign]_Copy_Variations.md` with all copy options organized by hook type.

---

### Phase 3: Format Selection (Design)

**Goal:** Match your copy to the ad format that will amplify it best.

#### Lo-Fi Native Formats (HIGH PERFORMANCE)

These formats look like organic content, not ads:

**1. Notes App Format**
- iPhone Notes screenshot style
- Checklist or bullet points
- Casual, relatable tone

**Example:**
```
"HOMESCHOOL MOM" STARTER PACK:

✓ Pinterest board full of activities you'll never have time for
✓ Coffee. Lots of coffee.
✓ Budget spreadsheet trying to make curriculum affordable

→ Or just join OpenEd and access resources without financial stress ←
```

**2. Text-Over-Video (UGC Style)**
- Real person, iPhone footage
- Text overlay tells the story
- Authentic setting (home, kitchen, car)

**Text Overlay Sequence Example:**
```
This is your sign ↓
You've decided to homeschool but don't know where to start.
Luckily, this tuition-free program helps you access curriculum, resources, and support...
...without the financial stress.
OpenEd: Education that fits YOUR family.
```

**3. Reddit/Tweet Screenshot**
- Looks like screenshot of social post
- Feels like discovery, not advertisement
- High engagement because familiar format

**4. Instagram Comment Format**
- Fake IG comment with voiceover response
- Native to platform
- Creates curiosity

**5. Meme Formats**
- Drake approval meme
- "Nobody: / Me:" format
- Distracted boyfriend
- Expectation vs Reality

**6. Sticky Note / Handwritten**
- Personal, intimate feel
- Stands out in polished feed
- Good for simple messages

**7. Testimonial Card**
- Quote + photo of real person
- Star rating visual
- Specific outcome highlighted

**8. Before/After Split**
- Visual transformation
- Works for emotional states, not just physical

#### Produced Formats (USE SPARINGLY)

**Talking Head Video**
- Direct to camera testimonial
- Expert/founder explanation
- Good for warm/retargeted audiences

**Demo/Walkthrough**
- Show the platform/product
- Good for product-aware audience
- Keep under 60 seconds

**Carousel**
- Multiple slides telling story
- Good for complex information
- Each slide must stand alone

#### Format Selection Matrix

| Audience Temp | Awareness Level | Best Formats |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Cold | Unaware | Meme, Reddit/Tweet, Notes App |
| Cold | Problem Aware | Text-over-video, Before/After |
| Warm | Solution Aware | Testimonial, Carousel, UGC |
| Hot | Product Aware | Talking Head, Demo, Direct offer |

**Design Phase Output:**
Select 3-5 formats that best match your copy and audience.

---

### Phase 4: Assembly & Variations

**Goal:** Combine copy + format into complete ad concepts, then generate variations for testing.

#### Step 1: Assemble Complete Ads

For each concept, document all 6 elements:

```markdown
## Ad Concept: [Name]

**Ad Type:** [Format selected]
**Target Audience:** [Segment]
**Awareness Level:** [1-5]

**Media:**
[Description of visual/video with specific details]

**Primary Text:**
[Full copy]

**Headline:**
[5-8 words]

**Description:**
[Secondary line]

**CTA Button:**
[Button choice]

**Page:**
[Landing page destination]
```

#### Step 2: Generate Testing Variations

**Hook Testing (Same Format, Different Hooks)**
- Create 3-5 versions with different opening lines
- Keep everything else identical
- Test to find winning hook

**Format Testing (Same Message, Different Formats)**
- Same core message across 3 formats
- Example: Notes App vs Text-over-video vs Meme
- Identify which format resonates

**Angle Testing (Same Format, Different Emotional Angles)**
- Fear-based vs Hope-based
- Urgency vs Aspiration
- Problem-focused vs Solution-focused

#### Step 3: Naming Convention

Use consistent naming for easy tracking:

`[Campaign]_[Format]_[Hook Type]_[Variation]`

Examples:
- `OpenEd_NotesApp_StarterPack_V1`
- `OpenEd_TextOverVideo_ThisIsYourSign_V2`
- `OpenEd_Meme_Drake_Budget_V1`

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Research Issues
- **Skipping research** - Writing from assumptions instead of customer language
- **Generic insights** - "Parents want good education" (too vague)
