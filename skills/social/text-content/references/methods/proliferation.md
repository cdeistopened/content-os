# Content Proliferation Methods

Use these methods to turn 1 idea into 1000 variations.

---

## Method 1: SCAMPER

Generate 7 variations from one post (one per letter).

### S - Substitute
**What can you replace?**
- The main idea with an adjacent concept
- The method/process for accomplishing the benefit
- The examples while keeping the structure
- The angle or pain point

**Example:**

Original:
> "The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

Substitute:
> "The most successful microschool founders don't start with curriculum. They start with committed families."

---

### C - Combine
**What can be combined?**
- Merge with personal experience or story
- Combine two similar concepts for more power
- Add a reply to someone else's post as your own content
- Combine data points for stronger evidence

**Example:**

Original:
> "The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

Combine:
> "I spent years thinking I needed a teaching credential to start a school. Then I met Dalena Wallace. She started with 3 families in her living room. Within months, 16 students. The most successful founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

---

### A - Adapt
**What can be added?**
- Expand Heavy-Hitting One-Liner into full post or thread
- Add "missing piece" that wasn't in original
- Adapt to different platform with same core idea
- Add data, examples, or proof points

**Example:**

Original:
> "The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

Adapt (expand to thread):
> "Thread: 3 things successful microschool founders start with (hint: not credentials)
>
> 1. Community (8-12 committed families)
> 2. A guide who cares (not necessarily a teacher)
> 3. A space to meet (living room, church, rec center)
>
> That's it. The rest you figure out together."

---

### M - Modify
**What can be modified, maximized, magnified, or minimized?**
- Magnify specific pain points (exaggeration for effect)
- Use same idea in different post format
- Make more "punchy" by removing words
- Minimize complexity, maximize impact

**Example:**

Original:
> "The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

Modify (magnify pain):
> "You're waiting for the 'perfect' teaching credential while your kid suffers in a system that wasn't designed for them. The most successful microschool founders don't wait. They start with community."

---

### P - Purpose (Put to other use)
**What other use or angle?**
- Angle for different audience segment
- What other benefit/pain point can this solve?
- Different context or application
- Different stage of journey (awareness vs action)

**Example:**

Original (for parents):
> "The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

Purpose (for burned-out teachers):
> "Burned out teachers: The most successful microschool founders aren't career educators. They're parents who wanted something better. You already have the skills. You just need 8-12 committed families."

---

### E - Eliminate
**What can be removed or simplified?**
- Remove words to make punchier
- Simplify complex explanations
- Cut nuance and uncertainty
- Reduce to core essence

**Example:**

Original:
> "The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

Eliminate:
> "Successful microschool founders start with community, not credentials."

---

### R - Reverse
**What happens if you reverse the idea?**
- Flip positive to negative (or vice versa)
- "With X you get Y" becomes "Without X you stay stuck with Z"
- Reverse the order or flow
- Challenge the original premise

**Example:**

Original (positive):
> "The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

Reverse (negative):
> "Without community, your teaching credentials mean nothing. Ask any burned-out public school teacher."

## Method 2: The 8 Human Desires

Spin concept through different desire lenses to create variations.

### The 8 Desires

1. **Safety of Tribe** - Belonging, protection, community
2. **Survival & Success** - Achievement, results, winning
3. **Life Enjoyment** - Fun, pleasure, experiences
4. **Social Acceptance** - Status, approval, fitting in
5. **Sexual Companionship** - Attraction, relationships (often not applicable)
6. **Comfort & Clarity** - Understanding, certainty, ease
7. **Freedom From Fear** - Overcoming obstacles, courage
8. **Perceived Status** - Recognition, reputation, respect

### How to Use

**Original Concept:** "Credentials vs Community"

**1. Safety of Tribe:**
> "Your kid needs a tribe that gets them. Not a credential on the wall. The most successful microschool founders build community first, credentials never."

**2. Survival & Success:**
> "The path to success isn't through credentials. It's through community. Every successful microschool founder knows this. The credential-obsessed schools are failing. The community-first microschools are thriving."

**3. Life Enjoyment:**
> "Life's too short to let credentials stop you from building the school your kid deserves. Successful microschool founders prioritize joy and community over paperwork and requirements."

**4. Social Acceptance:**
> "Worried what people will think if you start a school without a teaching credential? The most successful microschool founders worried about that too. Then they did it anyway. Now they're the ones other parents want to be like."

**5. Sexual Companionship:**
> (Skip - not applicable for education content)

**6. Comfort & Clarity:**
> "Starting a school feels overwhelming. Too many requirements, too many credentials needed. Here's what brings clarity: successful microschool founders don't start there. They start with 8-12 families who want something different. Everything else becomes clear after that."

**7. Freedom From Fear:**
> "The fear of 'not being qualified' stops more microschools than anything else. But here's the truth: the most successful founders aren't the most credentialed. They're the ones who pushed through that fear and started with community."

**8. Perceived Status:**
> "Society tells you credentials = status. But successful microschool founders know better. Real status comes from kids who love learning, parents who trust you, and a community you built from scratch."

## Method 3: Vision/Anti-Vision Framing

Frame concepts through your vision (what you're FOR) and anti-vision (what you're AGAINST).

### OpenEd Vision
- Personalized education tailored to each child
- Family autonomy and wholeness
- Kids who love learning
- Parents empowered, not inadequate
- Mix-and-match educational freedom

### OpenEd Anti-Vision
- One-size-fits-all standardization
- Institutional conformity and credential gatekeeping
- Kids who hate school
- Parents feeling helpless
- Educational monopoly

### How to Use

**Original Concept:** "Credentials vs Community"

**Vision Framing (what we're FOR):**
> "This is what educational freedom looks like: 8-12 families, a guide who cares, a space to meet. No credentials required. Just community. That's how the most successful microschools start. That's open education."

**Anti-Vision Framing (what we're AGAINST):**
> "The credential gatekeepers want you to believe you're not qualified. They want you dependent on their system. The most successful microschool founders ignored them and started with community instead. That's how you break the educational monopoly."

**Both (Transformation):**
> "From credential gatekeeping to community empowerment. From 'you're not qualified' to 'you and 8-12 families can do this.' The most successful microschool founders made this shift. You can too."

## Proliferation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify High Performers
- Monthly: Study top-performing posts
- Look for: Most followers, highest engagement, best conveys brand philosophy
- Save in separate document

### Step 2: Generate Variations
For each high performer:
- 7 SCAMPER variations
- 5-8 Human Desire reframes (skip non-applicable ones)
- 2-3 Vision/Anti-Vision frames
- **Total: 14-18 variations from 1 post**

### Step 3: Select & Schedule
- Pick best 3-5 variations
- Space out over weeks/months
- Test different angles with same core concept
- Track which variations perform best

### Step 4: Learn & Iterate
- Document which proliferation methods work best
- Note which Human Desires resonate most with audience
- Refine vision/anti-vision framing based on response
