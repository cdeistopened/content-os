# One-Liner Patterns

Bold, conversational one-liners that stop scrolling. Punchy statements designed for maximum shareability.

**Voice:** Confident, direct, slightly irreverent. Like texting a friend who tells it like it is.

**Best for:** Easel reveals, sign posts, quick social captions, video hooks, tweet-length content.

**Not for:** Long-form content, formal communications, anything requiring nuance.

## The 12 Core Patterns

### 1. Normalize Statements
**Format:** "Normalize [behavior/thing people feel guilty about]"

Challenges social pressure, gives permission.

**Examples:**
- "Normalize going to the movies alone"
- "Normalize Irish exit"
- "Normalize kids learning at their own pace" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** Validating something your audience does but feels judged for.

---

### 2. Stop + Complaint
**Format:** "Stop [annoying behavior everyone experiences]"

Direct command. No explanation needed. The complaint IS the hook.

**Examples:**
- "Stop showing sold-out items on your website"
- "Stop making burgers wider, not taller"
- "Stop acting like worksheets are learning" (OpenEd)
- "Stop calling it 'socialization' when it's just standing in line" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** Calling out universal frustrations. Works best when it's petty but relatable.

---

### 3. Everyday Observations
**Format:** "[Simple truth no one says out loud]"

Observational comedy meets social commentary. No command, just stating facts.

**Examples:**
- "January is the Monday of the year"
- "Finding something to watch shouldn't take longer than watching it"
- "Report cards don't measure curiosity" (OpenEd)
- "A diploma is just expensive paper if you're miserable" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** When you want to sound smart without being preachy.

---

### 4. Relationship & Social Rules
**Format:** "[Relationship expectation/boundary stated as law]"

Universal agreements about how people should behave. Works for friendships, dating, parenting.

**Examples:**
- "If we start a show together, you don't get to watch episodes without me"
- "If she says she's not hungry, get her extra food anyway"
- "If your kid loves dinosaurs, let them major in dinosaurs for a year" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** Creating solidarity around unspoken social contracts.

---

### 5. Pop Culture Commentary
**Format:** "[Take on pop culture that connects to your topic]"

Reference something trending, make it relevant to your message.

**Examples:**
- "Jolene, home wrecking"
- "Not everything is an era"
- "Minecraft is a STEM lab, admit it" (OpenEd)
- "Taylor Swift teaches history better than most textbooks" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** When you can hijack a cultural moment for your message.

---

### 6. Mock Instructions / Petty Commands
**Format:** "[Absurdly specific instruction]"

Like a PSA but sassier. Targets niche frustrations.

**Examples:**
- "The concert is over, take off your wristband"
- "Empty liquor bottles are not home decor"
- "Let the horse grade your essays - I'm more generous" (OpenEd)
- "Don't call it 'screen time' if they're coding" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** When the complaint is so specific it becomes funny.

---

### 7. Wordplay & Puns
**Format:** "[Play on words that makes your point]"

Language twist that's clever without being groan-worthy. Keep it tight.

**Examples:**
- "A dozen roses is less than a dozen rosés"
- "It's supposedly not supposubly"
- "Common Core? More like Common Bore" (OpenEd)
- "Parents are the mane teachers" (OpenEd horse voice)

**When to use:** When you have a genuinely good pun. Bad puns damage credibility.

---

### 8. Existential / Rhetorical Questions
**Format:** "[Question that makes people think]"

Not expecting an answer. The question IS the point.

**Examples:**
- "How do y'all keep plants alive?"
- "WTF are y'all running from?"
- "Why is lunch only 20 minutes?" (OpenEd)
- "Who decided bells mean learning is over?" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** Pointing out absurdity without stating it directly.

---

### 9. Aspirational / Motivational
**Format:** "[Permission or encouragement to do the thing]"

Positive spin. Less sarcastic, more empowering.

**Examples:**
- "This is your sign to do that thing you've been wanting to do"
- "To me, you are perfect"
- "This is your sign to drop the test prep workbook" (OpenEd)
- "Learning should feel like play" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** When you want to inspire action, not just complain.

---

### 10. Calendar & Time Commentary
**Format:** "[Observation about time/seasons/schedules]"

Everyone relates to calendar weirdness. Universal truth about timing.

**Examples:**
- "February 29th should be a holiday"
- "Next weekend means the weekend after this one coming up"
- "August isn't back-to-school, it's still summer" (OpenEd)
- "Every Friday should be a field trip" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** Seasonal content or pushing back on arbitrary schedules.

---

### 11. Everyday Struggles & Complaints
**Format:** "[Small struggle stated dramatically]"

Over-the-top about something minor. Self-deprecating but relatable.

**Examples:**
- "My tummy hurts, but I'm being brave about it"
- "You're not going to wake up early to finish packing"
- "Homework is a scam - change my mind" (OpenEd)
- "Finding the right curriculum shouldn't feel like jury duty" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** When you want to be vulnerable and funny at the same time.

---

### 12. Values & Bigger Themes
**Format:** "[Core belief stated simply]"

Philosophical but still punchy. Your worldview in one line.

**Examples:**
- "Talking shit together is a love language"
- "Earth Day is greater than every day"
- "Education should be open, not standardized" (OpenEd)
- "Funding should follow students, not systems" (OpenEd)

**When to use:** When you need to state your position clearly without being preachy.

---

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Pick Your Pattern
- **Normalize** = Validating something taboo
- **Stop** = Universal complaint
- **Observation** = Stating the obvious cleverly
- **Rules** = Setting boundaries
- **Pop Culture** = Hijacking a moment
- **Commands** = Petty but specific
- **Wordplay** = You have a good pun
- **Questions** = Pointing out absurdity
- **Aspirational** = Positive motivation
- **Calendar** = Time-based complaint
- **Struggles** = Relatable vulnerability
- **Values** = Core belief

### Step 2: Write Conversationally
Type like you're texting. Short sentences. Fragments okay. Read it out loud.

**Test:**
- Would you actually say this to a friend?
- Is it under 15 words? (ideal: 5-10)
- Does it sound natural, not "written"?

### Step 3: Make It Specific
Vague = forgettable. Specific = shareable.

- "Stop being annoying at concerts"
- "The concert is over, take off your wristband"

- "Education should be better"
- "Homework is a scam - change my mind"

### Step 4: Remove Unnecessary Words
Every word must earn its place.

**Before:** "I really think we should normalize the idea of going to the movies by yourself"
**After:** "Normalize going to the movies alone"

### Step 5: Add Edge (Optional)
If too safe, add bite. But don't force it.

**Safe:** "Learning at different paces is okay"
**Edge:** "Different brains, different timelines. Why is this controversial?"

## Two-Part Reveals (For Easels/Videos)

Sometimes you need setup + punchline:

**Setup (back to camera):**
"But what about socialization?"

**Reveal (turn around):**
"My kids talk to 2-year-olds, 20-year-olds, and 80-year-olds.
Not just kids born in 2018."

---

**Setup:**
"Kids don't hate math."

**Reveal:**
"They hate being forced to learn it
the same way
at the same time
as everyone else."
