### Example

```
Are you a CEO?
Do you know what your second-in-command wishes s/he could tell you...?

1. [First insight]
2. [Second insight]

```

Here are 3 things they wish they could tell you:

1. {{XXX}}
2. {{XXX}}
3. {{XXX}}

Agree/Disagree… leave it in the comments.

Is there anything else you think a {{XXX}} would want to tell the {{XXX}}?
Put it in the comments.

- Positions you as an honest broker between different roles

## 42. I call BS Post


### Description

This type of post challenges conventional wisdom or clichés by boldly calling them out as false, then providing a more realistic perspective.

### Example

```
"If you build it, they will come."

BS.

An entrepreneur asked me for advice last week. He's been working on a product so futuristic it's 5 steps ahead of the market.

The problem: he has zero clients.
And he's running out of money.

"What am I doing wrong?" he asked me.

"The market will never come to you," I said. "You have to go to the market."

It's a story I've heard hundreds of time.

And it's the reason why so many entrepreneurs fail-
They're not building something people need now.

A ton of customers magically showing up after you build something-
Only happens in Hollywood films.

Unless you've got a billion dollars in cash and you can see into the future-
You have to find your target audience now-
Identify a pain they're experiencing-
And come up with a damn good solution for it.

```

### Template

```
{{cliche quote}}

That's just BS.

Here's the problem with that statement: {{XXX}}

Instead, {{XXX}}.

In the long run, {{XXX}}.

```

### How It Works

- Creates immediate attention with a contrarian position
- Challenges commonly accepted wisdom
- Provides a more realistic alternative perspective
- Often draws from personal experience to build credibility
- Positions you as a straight-talker who cuts through hype

## 52. The "Say No" Post


### Description

Everyone has things they know they need to say "No" to, but often struggle with setting boundaries. This post provides permission and strategies for declining commitments.

### Example

```
When you are young, saying "yes" to many things is very powerful and important, but as you age and define who you are, then learning to say "no" becomes essential. Here's a list of things I've learned to say, "no, thanks" to.

1. {{XXX}}
2. {{XXX}}
3. {{XXX}}
4. {{XXX}}
5. {{XXX}}
6. {{XXX}}
7. {{XXX}}

I'm curious, what have you learned to say "no to" that improves your life.

## 57. "The Dark Side of ______________" Post

No talks about this.

The dark side of entrepreneurship.

2X more likely to suffer from depression
6X more likely to suffer from ADHD
3X more likely to suffer from substance abuse
2X more likely to have suicidal thoughts

Having our own business may seem like a cool and fun thing to do, but it's not easy for most.

This is why more than 80% of small businesses fail.

Yesterday was national HUG day.
Feb 12th.
I just found out about that today.
Who knew there was such a day.

I missed it by a day, but you know what… let's give out some hugs today.

Next time you want to hate an owner, you may want to give them a hug instead, as their job is probably way more stressful and harder than you could ever imagine.

Comment #hugsforentrepreaurs, if you want to send your appreciation to these hard working folks.

And tag some hard working entrepreneurs you know in the comments.

```

### Template

```
The dark side of {{XXX}} that nobody talks about:

- {{Challenging aspect}}
- {{Challenging aspect}}

{{Call to action for support or awareness}}

#hashtags

```

### How It Works

- Addresses rarely-discussed challenges of popular careers or trends
- Creates authenticity through honest acknowledgment of difficulties
- Shows empathy for those facing these challenges
- Often provides a balanced perspective on glamorized roles
- Creates space for others to share their experiences with these challenges

## 59. "Cut ______ From Your Life" Post


### Description

This type of post provides permission and frameworks for eliminating negative influences, which most people want to do but struggle with.

### Example

```
Cut toxic people from your life! How do you know if you have toxic people in your life?

1. They blame everyone for their problems (it's never their fault)
2. They talk behind people's backs.
3. They take more than they give.
4. They are constant debbie-downers, nothing is ever going well.
5. Their lives are constantly full of drama.
6. They can't let go when people have done them wrong.
7. They have an intense need to be right.
8. They dominate the conversation, really is a one way conversation.

We all go through a tough time in life and we all have had our boo-hoo moments of victimitis, however, if you have a friend, family or colleague who is ALWAYS like the above, then…

CUT-THEM-OUT-OF-YOUR-LIFE!

If someone is just having a tough time, give it some time and help them get outta their funk.

However, if they are truly toxic, then run the other way when you see them.

These toxic people will suck you dry and if you give them the time, they'll come back to do it again and again, until you decide to disengage.

Don't even feel like you owe them an explanation.

Most of the time they won't "get it" anyways and you'll just be another person who's wronged them.

My advice is to remove them and block them on social media and stop engaging.

It's harsh, but true.

Life is short, spend with those that energize you and met you in the middle.

Agree…?

Comment #nomoretoxicpeople if you agree.

```

### Template

```
Cut {{XXX}} from your life! How do you know if you have {{XXX}} in your life?

1. {{Sign/Behavior}}
2. {{Sign/Behavior}}
3. {{Sign/Behavior}}
4. {{Sign/Behavior}}
5. {{Sign/Behavior}}

{{Provide context and nuance}}

{{Explain why removal is necessary}}

{{Offer practical advice for removal}}

Life is too short for {{XXX}}.

Agree?

Comment #hashtag if you agree.

```

### How It Works

- Provides clear criteria for identifying negative influences
- Creates immediate recognition of these patterns
- Offers permission to prioritize one's wellbeing
- Provides practical advice for difficult situations
- Balances empathy with necessary boundaries

## 66. The Employee Rant Post


### Description

These posts perform well, especially when you advocate for employee rights and fair treatment in the workplace, because they tap into common frustrations.

### Example

```
Millions of American workers learned the hard way that when times get tough, employers will cut and run.

Loyalty has always been a one way street (despite what you've been told) and employees will always be the first to go in an attempt to cut costs.

Did you know the average CEO compensation has grown nearly 950% since 1978?

Did you also know that the people left behind are expected to do your job and their job? And, maybe even take a cut in pay?

Trust me when I say, they will continue to do business the same way, with less people, while their Executives continue to enjoy the same perks and benefits as always.

Before you tell me how this one or that one took a pay cut, keep in mind that a pay cut to a salary is nothing ... most of the compensation comes in the form of stock and bonus. So while it might be good PR to broadcast how this CEO and that CEO is taking a pay-cut, they are impacted very, very little.

But this post is not about them, this post is about YOU.

Keep loyalty in perspective.
Don't feel guilty for taking a better offer elsewhere.
Looking out for you and your family first is not being selfish, it is being an adult.

## 70. The Bad Boss Post


### Description

Everyone can relate to having a bad boss. These posts tap into universal experiences and create immediate emotional connection.

### Example

```
My boss raised his voice at me.

Told me I was too young to succeed at the bank.

Half the office heard him. I was humiliated.

Planswell served more clients in year one than he's served in his entire life.

People don't quit over money, perks, the office.
They quit disrespectful bosses.

```

## 72. Something You'll Never Hear Me Say Post


### Description

This works well because it's a great way to state your values without coming across as preachy. It shows your principles through the actions and words you won't tolerate.

### Example

```
"That's not my job."

Is something you'll never hear me say. I'm a Director of Marketing at Siege Media but in the past week I've...
- Written a blog post because our content marketing team was already booked up
- Helped HR with vetting and interviewing new applications
- Cleaned out the office fridge (thankfully, it was mostly empty since COVID hit.)

Sometimes you have to do things outside of your role and just get the work done.

```

### Template

```
"{{XXX}}"

Is something you'll never hear me say. I'm the {{job title}} at {{company name}} and in the last week I've…
- Awesome thing you did
- Awesome thing you did
- Awesome thing you did

```

### How It Works

- Demonstrates your values through concrete actions rather than abstract statements
- Shows your work ethic and approach to teamwork
- Creates authenticity through specific, real examples
- Positions you as someone who goes beyond job descriptions
- Often resonates with others who share similar values

## 80. Name Thy Enemy Post

### Example

```
Just remember... when life is tough. When your husband/wife/kids get mad at you. When your boss/employees/coworkers hurt your feelings. When things just generally don't go your way.

You can still trash salespeople on the internet.

All hope is not lost, keyboard warrior. You got this!

(Based on Experience)
(Based on Managers Mood)

People need jobs.
