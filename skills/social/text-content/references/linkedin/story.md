## 2. The "Before and After" Post


### Description

This strategy showcases transformation and results, which is inherently engaging. People love to see evidence of improvement and positive change, especially when it's visual.

### Example

```
[Image showing Before/After transformation]

What does your LinkedIn profile photo say about you?

First impressions matter.

```

### Template

```
[Image showing Before/After transformation]

{{Brief caption explaining the transformation}}

{{Insight about why this matters}}

```

### How It Works

- Uses before/after visuals to demonstrate transformation
- Keeps text minimal to let the images tell the story
- Provides a brief insight about why the transformation matters
- Implicitly invites viewers to consider their own situation


---

## 4. The "Work Vs Personal Life" Post


### Description

This strategy taps into the universal struggle of work-life balance, creating instant relatability and engagement.

### Example

```
Are you a workaholic and have kids?

If so, this video is for you.

[Video content]

```

### Template

```
Are you a {{XXX}} and struggle with {{XXX}}? Then this is for you.

{{Tell story}}

Comment below if you can relate and tag those you love that need to hear this message.

```

### How It Works

- Targets a specific audience with a direct question
- Addresses a common struggle most professionals face
- Provides personal stories or actionable advice
- Explicitly asks for comments and tags, expanding reach


---

## 6. The "Failure" Post


### Description

Everyone loves an underdog story. Share your failures and how you overcame them to create a compelling narrative that resonates with readers.

### Example

```
I have received enough rejection letters and emails that I could wallpaper my entire house. (And my house is 15,000 square feet) (just go with it)

(Give or take 14,000 square feet)

I have been rejected by schools.
I've lost out on jobs.
I've lost a few bids.
I've lost a boyfriend or two. (Big mistake. Yuge)

I've been rejected on a boat, and even once by a goat. Rejected wearing a faux fur hat and by some seedy slimy rat. (True story) I've been rejected in a house and picked over for mouse.

I should have given up 32,741 times. (Precisely)
(But) that was never, ever an option.
Ever.

So get up. Wipe the dust off you. (See what I did there) and go get 'em tiger.
It's your turn!

Now go and have the best week in the history of the entire world.
Just saying.

```

### Template

```
I have failed {{XXX}} times.

Here's a list of some of my biggest failures:
- Failure 1
- Failure 2
- Failure 3
- Failure 4
- Failure 5
- Failure 6
- Failure 7
- Failure 8

But what was never an option, was to give-up.
Ever.

So get up.
Wipe the dust off you.
And go get your dream!

```

### How It Works

- Creates vulnerability through admission of failures
- Uses humor to make the message more palatable
- Builds to an inspirational conclusion
- Encourages readers through your personal resilience story
- Leverages storytelling to create emotional connection


---

## 13. The "Movie Script" Post


### Description

This works because everyone loves dialogue and stories. Creating a conversational back-and-forth captures attention and makes complex ideas accessible.

### Example

```
MANAGER: You are late!
EMPLOYEE: It is only 9:21 am
MANAGER: Work starts at 9:00 am. I will have to write you up for this.
EMPLOYEE: But I am not usually late, but I had to take my child to daycare today because my husband couldn't this morning. I stayed late yesterday & got up early this morning to answer emails. Could you just let me off this one time?
MANAGER: We can't because this would set the wrong example that it's okay to be late.

It's time for managers to stop micromanaging their team.

If you have to do that to a person you hired, then you hired the wrong person, to begin with.

You know what happens when you to do this to an employee?
They tell themselves they are not going to work from home, or come early ever again or stay late to finish a project. They will just arrive and leave on time, but not give a S*"T anymore.

This type of indifference is what kills the culture & any business.

I think it's funny how many managers will never complain when employees go the extra mile, but they think it's okay to point out employees mistakes.

A great manager will spend 90% of their time publicly praising & inspiring their team to be their best & 10% providing private real-time constructive feedback.

A great manager will have your back & set you up for success.

Agree?

```

### Template

```
PERSON 1: {{dialogue}}
PERSON 2: {{dialogue}}
PERSON 1: {{dialogue}}
PERSON 2: {{dialogue}}

{{Tell the moral of the story}}

Do you agree…. Why or why not… leave it in the comments!

```

### How It Works

- Creates an engaging story format that's easy to follow
- Uses dialogue to illustrate common workplace situations
- Builds to a clear lesson or insight
- Addresses workplace dynamics that many people experience
- Explicitly asks for agreement or disagreement to drive comments


---

## 14. The "Someone Was Wronged" Post


### Description

This works because everyone hates when someone has been wronged unfairly. People naturally want to express support and share their own similar experiences.

### Example

```
Recently, I forwarded the resume of a very skilled and smart lady who had taken a 10-year career break to raise her children. The feedback I got from the interview was very disappointing.

"She seems super smart, but 10 years is a long time, we can't take that risk."

She had taken the break to be a stay-at-home mom for her three young boys.

I know this person, and she would crush anything they touched. It made me so mad to hear this.

I personally gravitate towards people who've taken a different path or who've taken employment gaps. I think those people usually have something extra to offer because of those experiences.

I also got thinking that we have a long way to come when it comes to understanding time off to raise children. Our society needs to change.

A gap in employment history should not discount someone's abilities.

All that should matter is if the candidate has the right skills and attitude to do the job.

One of my very best employees had 7-year employee gap because they ran a family SMB business for 5 years and then took care of their sick mother for 2 years. I am so glad I didn't care about that employee gap on their resume.

Take a chance on hiring people with employee gaps, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Agree?

```

### Template

```
Recently, I witnessed {{XXX}}

This is not okay.

All that should matter is {{XXX}}

Please {{XXX}}

Agree?

```

### How It Works

- Tells a story of injustice that elicits emotional responses
- Takes a moral stand that most people can agree with
- Challenges commonly-held biases or prejudices in professional settings
- Offers a more ethical alternative approach
- Ends with a question that invites support and similar stories

## 15. The "Things I've Learned Birthday" Post


### Description

This is another spin on the listicle post. Everyone loves a big list of things people have learned throughout their life or career, especially when presented as wisdom gained over time.

### Example

```
I just turned 43, so I thought I'd share 43 random tips
1) Listen ... before you talk.
2) Focus and go deep ... before you switch gears.
3) Think ... before you act.
4) Save ... before you spend.
5) Try ... before you quit.
6) Don't wear socks ... with Crocs.
7) Delete social media ... off your phone.
8) Be a forever student ... before you decide to Mentor.
9) If you want to get things done ... block the time off in your calendar.
10) If you want to be wealthy ... understand how compound interest works.
[...]

```

### Template

```
{{State major milestone}}, so I thought I'd share {{XXX}} I've learned over the last {{XXX}} years.

1. The secret to {{XXX}} is {{XXX}}.
2. Never {{XXX}} while {{XXX}} because it will {{XXX}}.
3. If you want {{XXX}} be sure to {{XXX}}, otherwise you'll get {{XXX}}.
4. Success is {{XXX}} and not {{XXX}}.
5. Here's what {{XXX}} won't tell you about {{XXX}}. Avoid {{XXX}} at all costs, so you can get {{XXX}}.

```

### How It Works

- Uses a personal milestone as a reason to share wisdom
- Presents actionable tips in an easily digestible list format
- Mixes serious advice with lighter, more humorous points
- Creates space for people to comment on which tips resonated most
- Positions you as experienced and insightful in your field

## 17. The "All The Jobs I've Had" Post


### Description

This one works because people love to see the journey others have taken. It humanizes you and showcases your diverse experience while inviting others to share their own paths.

### Example

```
Don't forget where you came from. Its what makes you interesting.

Newspaper boy. Babysitter. Construction worker. Lifeguard. Swim instructor. Lawn Maintenance Worker. Shovelled dirt in Bags. Theatre Actor. Screen Actor. Waiter. Door-to-door salesperson. Telemarketer. Network Marketer. Belly Dancer. Director. Manager. CMO. COO. Entrepreneur. (ok one may be fictional...you guess)

Some jobs were terrible and some were great but each job taught me something that has stuck with me for life.

The big thing I've learned (if you are open to it), is you never know whom you will meet and how they will impact your life.

We all have our own journeys. Enjoy the ride!

P.S. List all the jobs you've had in the comments. It's fun and it takes 30 seconds to do. I always find it amazing to see all the fun stuff people have done.

I hope everyone has a brilliant weekend!

```

### Template

```
Don't forget where you've come from. Here's a list of all the jobs I've had and what I learned from each one.

1. {{XXX}}
2. {{XXX}}
3. {{XXX}}
4. {{XXX}}
5. {{XXX}}
6. {{XXX}}
7. {{XXX}}
8. {{XXX}}

Your turn.

Either list all the jobs you've had in the comments or tell me which of my job lessons was your favorite.

```

### How It Works

- Shows your diverse background and journey
- Humanizes you by revealing unexpected or humble beginnings
- Demonstrates growth and learning from various experiences
- Explicitly invites others to share their own job histories
- Creates a space for connection through shared experiences

## 19. The "Out of Office" Post


### Description

Keep people posted about your vacation and what you are grateful for. Sometimes simple real-life updates are what people want. It gives them a sneak peek behind the scenes of a real human being.

### Example

```
OFFICIAL OUT OF THE OFFICE ALERT

Hey friends! I'm heading to Cuba this week. I chose this destination because the Internet there is the worst. And for me ... that means an actual vacation...

```

### Template

```
Formal Out-Of-Office Announcement!

Hey there! Checking myself out of work and into {{destination}} for some good old R&R. Excited to close the laptop and open a beer. See ya in a {{time you are gone}}!

```

### How It Works

- Breaks from typical business content to show your human side
- Creates a sense of authenticity and work-life balance
- Often generates good wishes and travel recommendations
- Shows that even successful professionals need downtime
- Can spark conversations about vacation spots and work-life balance


---

## 27. The "Doing The Unexpected" Post


### Description

This type of post works by sharing a story where someone has wronged you but you responded with kindness instead. People love these posts because they demonstrate character and values.

### Example

```
In are politeness, I got this message "I won't be coming for the interview. I have an interview with Amazon on the same day."

We invited a young web developer for an interview after he applied for the role. Unfortunately for him, it clashed with another interview. He messaged us that he wouldn't come.

Although it looked a bit awkward, this was a young man who had never been employed since he graduated two years ago. To be invited by a company like Amazon is huge for him. I could imagine. We wished him well.

Three days after, he contacted us that he didn't get the job. He asked if he could still be interviewed. Of course! We rescheduled him. He came and did well. We hired him.

He couldn't believe that he could still get the job. He was on cloud nine and so teary. He couldn't stop thanking me...

I told him I had not done anything special...

All I see in you is talent. I can't prevent you from going to a big company. I feel happy when people are making progress. Amazon inviting you shows that you are unique. Enjoy your success.

He resumed and did well for us before moving to a bigger company a couple of years after.

The sky is vast for everyone to fly. When job seekers or employees see more significant opportunities, support them. Let them go. Be happy for them.

```

### Template

```
{{Tell a once upon a time story. Set the plot briefly}}

{{Tell a roadblock}}

{{Explain how you unexpectedly handled the situation}}

{{Bring it full circle with words of wisdom}}

```

### How It Works

- Creates a narrative arc with conflict and resolution
- Demonstrates your values through actions rather than statements
- Shows your leadership philosophy in practice
- Provides an inspirational message that others can apply
- Often generates comments about similar experiences


---

## 35. The Failure Story Post


### Description

Everyone loves a good underdog story about how you failed at something before succeeding. It builds connection through vulnerability and inspires others.

### Example

```
I failed pre-Ranger school.
Because I couldn't do 12 pull-ups.
But they sent me to Afghanistan anyway.

I was a Fire Support Officer.
But not Ranger-qualified.
Not a day went by when I didn't think about that tab.

Even after I earned everyone's respect by keeping my soldiers safe.

When I came back to my base in Italy after 15 months of combat-
My girlfriend moved across the ocean to be with me.
2 weeks later, I decided to leave and try again.

"You better come back wearing that tab," she told me
So I flew to the US.
Spent 2 months in the snowy Georgia mountains and Florida swamps without sleep.
Lost 30 pounds.
And was so exhausted I started hallucinating.

But I passed.

```

### Template

```
I failed {{XXX}}.
Because I couldn't {{XXX}}.
But I kept doing {{XXX}}.

Soon I was able to {{XXX}}.
Then after {{XXX}} I was able to {{XXX}}.

I realized two things along the way:
First, {{XXX}}
Second, {{XXX}}

It's {{XXX}} that drives success.

Comment #HASHTAG if you have failed and overcome it with {{XXX}}.

```

### How It Works

- Creates vulnerability through admission of failure
- Builds a narrative arc from failure to eventual success
- Shows perseverance and resilience
- Provides lessons learned from the experience
- Inspires others to persevere through their own challenges

## 50. The "What Really Matters in Life" Post


### Description

Everyone loves a good inspirational post. If you tie these posts to Friday or to holidays and tell people to enjoy their weekends/holidays, it can perform especially well.

### Example

```
My mother recently retired. She had this quote taped to her computer: "Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air. You name them work, family, health, friends and spirit. And you're keeping all of these in the air. You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls - family, health, friends and spirit - are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered. They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life." - Brian Dyson, former CEO of Coca-Cola

It served my Mom well.

I will now print off this same quote/passage and add it to the wall of my office too.

I think we do a pretty good job of promoting this at @poweredbysearch, but it's that important of a reminder that I want it front and center so I can always remember what is really important in life.

```

### Template

```
It's {{Friday/Holiday}} and we are all working hard, but remember what really matters in life.

Here are 10 things you could do this weekend to create more memories you can cherish.

1. Idea
2. Idea
3. Idea
4. Idea
5. Idea
6. Idea
7. Idea
8. Idea
9. Idea
10. Idea

Which one will you do this weekend? Put the number in the comments or write your own ideas, if you have something different in mind.

#love

```

### How It Works

- Creates perspective by focusing on what truly matters
- Often timed with weekends or holidays when reflection is natural
- Provides actionable ideas for meaningful activities
- Shows your values and priorities
- Invites participation through sharing plans or preferences


---

## 60. The "Values" Post


### Description

People don't buy WHAT you sell, but WHY you do it. These posts reveal your core values through personal stories, helping others connect with your deeper motivations.

### Example

```
My dad passed when I was 10. He was hardworking, humble, always smiling, had travelled the world, and was loved and appreciated by everyone he met. He could cheer up your day with a smile and a wink, or a cheeky comment. At his funeral, the church was BURSTING with people who wanted to say goodbye. He had no money, very little education, but he MATTERED to people, even those who barely knew him. He was 41.

My grandfather passed when I was 32. He was a narcissist. He was selfish self congratulatory, and he never did anything for anyone unless there was something in it for himself. Family would visit him begrudgingly. He made you feel bad about yourself in subtle ways. He was a bully, with no friends. At his funeral, a few people came, out of a sense of duty. No one cried. No one would miss him. He was 78.

Memories of both of these events shape my behaviour every single day, because I'd rather die young, having lived a life that mattered and made a difference, than live a long, lonely life filled with negativity.

#life #bitdeep #makeittcount

```

### Template

```
[Tell a personal story that illustrates your core values]

[Connect these values to how you work with others]

```

### How It Works

- Creates emotional connection through personal storytelling
- Reveals your deeper motivations and character
- Helps potential clients/employers understand your "why"
- Creates authenticity and humanizes your professional persona
- Often creates strong resonance with those who share similar values

## 74. The "Share Your Goals" Post


### Description

People love to share and help. Being a little vulnerable about your aspirations can go a long way on LinkedIn.

### Example

```
They say writing down and publicly sharing your goals increases your chances at achieving them.

So here are some of my goals
A. {{XXX}}
B. {{XXX}}
C. {{XXX}}

Let me know which one you think I should focus on first in the comments.

Tell me yours in the comments too.

Thanks!

## 81. The Scorned/Revenge Story Post


### Description

This works because everyone can relate to being wronged professionally and enjoys seeing justice or personal triumph emerge from an unfair situation.

### Example

```
She didn't get the promotion she'd been promised.

She had worked her ass off, managing a bigger team and 'unofficially' filled the role left vacant by her boss who left the company.

When the bosses boss approached her to step in a fill the role temporarily, he'd assured her she would be a shoo in when the position was filled.

He lied.

For 6 months, she did her own job and the job her old boss left. She did it without any extra pay. She did it without any title or perk or support.

She was thrilled when she got the call to officially interview for the promotion, thought it would be a formality. It wasn't.

Delay after delay, excuse after excuse, nearly 8 months assuming this temporary role, she was told they were bringing in an outside candidate to fill the job. (An old buddy of the COO).

She was crushed! Devastated. She felt foolish and embarrassed.

When she called us to work with her on her resume, she was defeated and depressed. After talking with me she got mad and fired up! (I tend to do that).

This week, after a 3 month job search, she landed that same VP level job at a competitor of her old employer where she'll go head to head with the guy that got her promotion.

She's got something to prove.

#resumewriting #dontpissoffsmartwomen #success

```

### Template

```
She/he didn't get {{XXX}} she'd/he'd been promised.

She/he worked their ass off by ….

When the boss told her/him ….

She/he was thrilled when they ....

Months had gone by and still no …

Then they found out …

They were rightfully crushed.

60 days later she/he ended up ....

Now that boss needs to deal with …

Who do you think has more energy to win?

```

### How It Works

- Creates an emotionally engaging narrative arc
- Addresses common workplace injustices
- Provides satisfaction through ultimate triumph
- Often validates feelings of being undervalued
- Inspires others in similar situations to persevere


---

## 84. I Was Fired Post


### Description

Sharing your experience of being fired or laid off creates vulnerability and connection. Many people have had this experience but few discuss it openly.

### Example

```
Have you been fired? How did you deal with it?

Today I'm sharing a story about how I was fired as COO at a $100M company...

[Story about being fired]

And I started to cry

```

### Template

```
Have you ever been fired or laid off?

Here's my story:

[Share your experience of being fired/laid off]

[Share what you learned or how you recovered]

```

- Provides hope and perspective for others in similar situations
- Shows resilience and growth from setbacks
- Often leads to others sharing their own experiences

Uses Chrome ALL THE TIME (even my SEO Pro extension is currently available only for Chrome)
Can't live without Google Sheets

What's your before/after? Share in the comments!

## 97. Share a recent conversation you've had


### Description

Sharing real conversations (anonymized when appropriate) provides authentic insights while maintaining storytelling appeal.

### Example

```
4 days left in the Q. I said to my rep
"If Procurement comes back and asks for something else after this, I'm going to walk away. Are you ok with that?"
he said "Yes."

We went in with a creative and aggressive proposal. We added a little extra to give
Procurement a win, but Procurement knew we had 4 days left until our end of Q.

So Procurement asked for another discount. I finally said...

"We really gave you a great deal. We really want to do business with you, but not like this. I'm afraid we have to walk away."... "However"...
(always give it one last "However" before walking away)

"Please let the Business Unit know we would still honor the proposal on the table
for the remainder of the Q."

Then we walked away...

No communication for the rest of that day or the entire next day.

I knew 2 things:
1) The business needed our solution.
2) We gave them a great deal.

Two days left he called back.
Deal was done on the last day of the Q.

Not every deal will be the same, but every
deal should be a great deal for your customer.

Giving your buyer a great deal from the start will give you the confidence to
walk away from a bad negotiation and will
make the buyer realize how good of a deal they're getting.

## Framework 17: The "My Biggest Professional Regret" Post


### Description

Sharing professional regrets or mistakes creates authenticity while providing valuable cautionary tales for others.

### Example

```
My biggest professional regret:

Staying in a toxic work environment for 2 years too long because of the prestige of the company name.

What I sacrificed:
• My mental health
• Creative growth
• Work-life balance
• Better opportunities
• Authentic relationships

The prestige wasn't worth it. No one cares where I worked a decade ago, but the time I lost can never be recovered.

What's your biggest professional regret?

## Framework 19: The "Behind the Scenes" Post


### Description

Sharing the unseen work behind your professional accomplishments creates authenticity while demystifying success for others.

### Example

```
Behind the scenes of my "overnight success" TEDx talk:

• 12 rejected applications before being accepted
• 47 drafts of my script over 3 months
• 27 practice sessions recorded and critiqued
• 2 complete rewrites of the entire talk
• 4 professional coaching sessions
• 8 hours of practice the day before
• 3 anxiety attacks backstage
• 17 minutes on stage that looked "effortless"

Success is like an iceberg - most of the work happens below the surface.

What "overnight success" have you worked years to achieve?

```

### Template

```
Behind the scenes of my [achievement/deliverable]:

• [Unseen work/effort]
• [Unseen work/effort]
• [Unseen work/effort]
• [Unseen work/effort]
• [Unseen work/effort]
• [Unseen work/effort]

[Reflection on the hidden nature of professional effort]

What hidden work supports your visible achievements?

```

### How It Works

- Creates authenticity by revealing the unglamorous side of success
- Helps others set realistic expectations for their own journey
