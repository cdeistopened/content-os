## 58. "You Can't Google _____________" Post


### Description

There's always something that can't be easily looked up and needs to be earned through experience. This post type highlights the value of experiential knowledge.

### Example

```
You can't Google experience! Tech companies are looking for that 28-year-old with 20 years experience. Well, guess what...?! It doesn't exist.

I think a lot of tech companies would do a lot better if they saw the value in experience. The tech can be learned, as they say, if you have the will you can get the skill. I think AGEISM in the tech workplace is very real and can't be made acceptable anymore. Everyone is going to need to help to solve this problem.

It's time for a change.

```

### Template

```
Point blank, you can't Google {{XXX}}! Companies are looking for {{XXX}}, but it simply won't work by Googling it.

I think it would be better if {{XXX}}.

Thoughts?

"Two Beers and a Puppy": A Helpful Test for Determining How You Feel About Someone

"Two Beers and a Puppy" is a test that I developed while working on an Esquire story on the American "son of a bitch." The test is: In order to find out how you actually feel about someone, ask yourself: "Would I have two beers with this person?" And: "Would I allow this person to look after my puppy over a weekend?"

## 87. Answer a common question post followed by an AMA offer

Answering FAQs as snackable content is a great way to add value. Following up with an "Ask Me Anything" invitation creates engagement opportunities.

### Example

```
"How do I get access to more people in my account when my main contact won't let me talk to anyone?"

1. Easiest: Set the expectation on who needs to be involved, clearly - not implied, in the first meeting or onboarding call. Make it sound normal and typical and you will be shocked how many people go with it.

2. You get introduced to who you sound like. Write that down my Account management friends. If you talk about tactical and technical details, don't be surprised you are only allowed to talk to one department or user group.

3. Slow play and really invest in the relationship. Make sure you do 4-5 things for them before the ask.

4. Have names ready. Don't make people work for it. "I many times work with xyz group and saw Rachel Smith was the head of xyz at your company so thought it would be good... "

These four things will help you up your quality and quantity of contacts in all your current customers.

## 88. Welcome newbies or write a piece for beginners


### Description

Creating content specifically for newcomers to your industry or platform positions you as helpful and welcoming while serving an underrepresented audience.

### Example

```
PSA to all "newbies" here:

There are a lot of people, with big "followings" that are going to TELL you what you NEED and MUST do to be successful on LinkedIn.

Yes, online authenticity can be manufactured!

They mask this content with an altruistic hue, but there are hidden agendas to get you into their funnels/streams to warm you up to sell you a BS course.

Here are a couple of free tips:

1. You do you: focus on creating content around what you know well and feel passionate about. Do not feel obligated to post "feel good, rah rah" content be you see the big names doing it.

2. Be mindful of "influencers" followers and engagement. Lots of "hacks" out there and people paying (one way or another) to drive engagement metrics to boost their optics.

3. Test and learn, try new things (text, video, images)- see what resonates.

4. Be Patient- real, intentional & meaningful growth and networking takes time and effort.

Shortcuts = shortcomings

Just be yourself, have fun and don't stress out!
Nothing worthwhile comes easy...

```

### Template

```
Are you new here? Welcome! Here are a few pointers I wish someone told me when I first {{XXX}}:

1. Don't be intimidated by {{XXX}}. Because {{XXX}}.
2. Be mindful of {{XXX}}.
3. Don't worry about {{XXX}}.
4. {{XXX}} is not as important as you think.

Just have some fun! I promise we don't bite.

## 95. Make a Sports Analogy


### Description

People love sports and can readily understand complex business concepts when framed through familiar sporting principles.

### Example

```
In boxing you want to stick and move
Throw a punch or a combination then move out of the way before you get hit.

Same idea in sales.
You'll always get punches/objections thrown at you.
The key is to counter with an answer and MOVE on.
Don't stand there waiting for the next punch.

There's a natural tendency for salespeople to answer a question and wait
for the next question or wait and see how the buyer reacts to their answer.

Whether you're cold calling or presenting, answer the question and keep it moving.

It's OK to get hit with objections from time to time, but as soon as you address them,
bring the convo back on track - finish the meeting strong and get to the next round.

You can tell a doctor to hurry up and finish the operation in 10 seconds, but the doctor won't even take you seriously.
Don't rush through your pitch or process or else the prospect won't take you seriously either.

What success ACTUALLY requires in consulting (that no one talks about):

• Specializing until you become the obvious choice for specific problems
• Investing in skills that compound over decades, not quarters
