## 1. The "Agree or Disagree" Post


### Description

This strategy works by asking people to participate with a yes/no response while layering it with a personal story that adds emotional depth and relatability.

### Example

```
A lousy job with a good boss is better than a good job with a lousy boss.

Agree?

I was talking to a friend this weekend and they told me about this terrible experience they had at work.

They said to me, "My boss made a mistake on a project we were working on, and instead of owning his mistake, he said it was my fault. I sat through that meeting feeling shocked and disappointed. When we left the meeting, he told me, 'You are a good sport.' I knew I needed to start planning my exit strategy. I love my job, but I can't trust my boss."

It's demotivating being under a bad manager. I've had some bad bosses and it really makes a huge difference on "whom you work with" vs "what you work on" each day. I think a lousy job with a good boss and great co-workers is better than a good job with a lousy boss or co-workers who don't have your back.

I'm curious... what do you think...? Comment below.

```

### Template

```
{{Make a statement}}

Agree or disagree...? Leave it in the comments.

I was talking to a friend this weekend and they told me about this terrible experience they had at work.

They said to me, "{{share the terrible experience}}"

Here's what I've come to learn over the years...

{{insight and a good perspective on life… OR … you can also insert a quote if you can't come up with something}}

I'm curious...what do you think...?

Comment below.

```

### How It Works

- Opens with a controversial or thought-provoking statement that demands a position
- Invites engagement with a simple agree/disagree prompt
- Shares a relatable personal story that illustrates the statement
- Provides your perspective or insight on the issue
- Ends with an explicit call to action for comments

## 5. The "Free Advertising" Post


### Description

This strategy works because everyone wants to promote their business. When you give them permission to be promotional, people will jump at the opportunity.

### Example

```
Go ahead -> Advertise on this post. Leave ONE sentence on who you help and how you help in the comments. It's your elevator pitch.

1000s of people will see it.

RULES:
You have to keep to 1 sentence.

HOW TO HELP:
Everyone will give you feedback or ideas on your 1-sentence pitch.

ARE YOU STUCK…?
If you are stuck, say "I'm stuck" and I'll look at your profile and make some suggestions.

```

### Template

ARE YOU STUCK…?
If you are stuck, say "I'm stuck" and I'll look at your profile and make some suggestions.

```

### How It Works

- Gives permission for self-promotion (normally discouraged)
- Creates clear constraints (one sentence only)
- Offers value (feedback and visibility)
- Creates an additional engagement hook for those who are "stuck"
- Leverages others' desire for visibility

## 8. The "Run a Poll" Post


### Description

This works because everyone likes to give their opinion. Using images and asking people to select preferences creates engaging, participatory content.

### Example

```
Which profile photo do you think scored better ... ? A or B ... ? Put your answer in the comments, then read below.

[Images of two different profile photos]

```

### Template

```
Which of these {{XXX}} do you prefer? I personally think that {{XXX}}, but I am interested to hear your answers. Give me your reasoning in the comments!!!

```

### How It Works

- Creates easy engagement with a simple question
- Uses visuals to increase post appeal
- Creates curiosity (people want to know which one performed better)
- Explicitly asks for comments with reasoning, deepening engagement
- Offers your opinion, inviting agreement or disagreement


---

## 9. "Which Would You Rather" Post


### Description

Similar to a poll, this type of post asks people to choose between options and explain their reasoning, driving deeper engagement.

### Example

```
Which would you prefer?

A) A website that gets 100,000 visits per month and converts at 0.05% to SQLs.
or
B) A website that gets 10,000 visits per month and converts at 5% to SQLs?

Tell us which is better and why in the comments.

```

### Template

```
What would you do {{describe the situation they might be in}}?

Would you rather:
A. {{example 1}}
OR
B. {{example 2}}

Pros and Cons to both. Leave your answer and reason why in the comments!

```

### How It Works

- Presents a clear choice between two options
- Encourages analytical thinking
- Explicitly asks for reasoning, which drives deeper comments
- Creates a natural discussion between people with different preferences
- Often reveals interesting insights about your audience's priorities

## 10. The "What Impresses You vs Doesn't Impress You" Post


### Description

Sharing a post of good behavior vs bad behavior and asking people if they agree or not is powerful and will trend.

### Example

```
I have met & worked with a lot of leaders over the last 10 years. The ONLY thing that impresses me when I meet a leader is how they treat their people.

I am not impressed by how much you make.
I am not impressed by your job title.
I am not impressed by your ambitious KPIs.
I am not impressed by your fancy office.
I am not impressed by your entrepreneur network.

What impresses me is when I see a leader who puts their team first.
I am impressed by leaders who have staff who work for them for 10+ years.
You know they have great leaders because no one would stay at a company for 10+ years anymore without great leaders.

People do business with people.
Focusing on growing your people is how you focus on the long game. Leaders who show they continue to grow their people even after they've moved on from their company is a sign of a great leader. Too many leaders don't celebrate their employee alumni enough.

Treating people well is how you WIN in business.
The long game is always focusing on people.

Do you agree?

```

### Template

```
I have met & worked with a lot of {{XXX}} over the last {{XXX}} years. The ONLY thing that impresses me when I meet a {{XXX}} is how they {{XXX}}

I am not impressed by {{XXX}}
I am not impressed by {{XXX}}
I am not impressed by {{XXX}}
I am not impressed by {{XXX}}

What impresses me is when I see a {{XXX}} who {{XXX}}.

Do you agree?

```

### How It Works

- Creates clear contrast between superficial achievements and meaningful qualities
- Uses repetitive structure for emphasis
- Speaks to deeper values that most people share
- Ends with a clear call for agreement/disagreement
- Allows people to signal their values by agreeing

## 28. Fun Game/Trivia Posts


### Description

Everyone loves games and trivia. These posts create easy, lightweight engagement that feels fun rather than work-related.

### Example

```
Friday fun anyone?

Favourite line from a movie...

Oooh but don't tell us the movie - we have to guess!!!

```

### Template

```
Let's take a step away from the normal biz-related posts. Let's switch it up to something fun!

{{Ask a question, or any sort of post that requires a CTA}}

```

### How It Works

- Creates a break from serious business content
- Generates easy, low-effort engagement
- Shows your personality and playful side
- Creates community through shared cultural references
- Often generates far more comments than typical business content


---

## 29. The "Crowdsource" Post


### Description

This works because people love to participate and look smart on LinkedIn. Start the work to add value and then ask the LinkedIn community to help you finish your work.

### Example

```
Here's a list of 20 great LinkedIn posts you can write this coming month. Just insert your topic of expertise in the blank

"_ Little Known Ways to Save on Your __"

```

### Template

```
Freebie! Here's 10 things you can do this week to {{XXX}}

Anything you would add?

```

### How It Works

- Provides immediate value through your initial list or resource
- Explicitly invites additional contributions
- Makes commenters feel valued for their expertise
- Creates a resource more valuable than what you could create alone
- Often generates substantial engagement as people build on each other's ideas

## 37. How Do You Know If You Are a _____________ Post


### Description

These posts work well because they grab the attention of anyone wondering if they fit that description, and provide a clear framework for self-assessment.

### Example

```
How do you know if you are a micro-manager...?

You do any of the following things:
1. You're never quite satisfied with deliverables.
2. You often feel frustrated because you would've gone about the task differently.
3. You laser in on the details and take great pride and/or pain in making corrections.
4. You constantly want to know where all your team members are and what they're working on.
5. You ask for frequent updates on where things stand.
6. You prefer to be cc'd on emails.

Micromanagement suffocates, demoralizes and kills creativity.

I love this quote by Peter Drucker: "A manager who starts with the assumption that people are weak, irresponsible and lazy will get weakness, irresponsibility, and laziness."

What are some other signs that might make someone a micro-manager...?
Leave it in the comments.

#hr #management #leadership

```

### Template

```
How do you know if you are a {{XXX}}?

You do any of the following things:
1.{{XXX}}
2.{{XXX}}
3.{{XXX}}
4.{{XXX}}
5.{{XXX}}
6.{{XXX}}
7.{{XXX}}

What are some other signs that would tell you are a {{XXX}}?
Leave it in the comments.

```

### How It Works

- Creates immediate curiosity and self-assessment
- Provides clear criteria for identification
- Often addresses problematic behaviors people may not recognize in themselves
- Encourages additional suggestions in comments
- Positions you as insightful about human behavior and psychology

## 38. Pick 'This' vs 'That' Post


### Description

Make a short statement about what is better and ask for comments. The binary choice format makes engagement easy and drives opinionated responses.

### Example

```
Pick a 'BOSS' instead of picking a 'JOB'.

Agree or Disagree...?

Leave in the comments.

P.S. I think people forget it's a two-way street and you get to interview your potential bosses just as much as they get to interview you.

```

### Template

```
Pick {{XXX}} vs {{XXX}}.

Agree or disagree?

Leave it in the comments.

```

### How It Works

- Creates a simple binary choice that's easy to respond to
- Encourages opinionated responses
- Invites personal experiences and reasoning
- Often touches on professional values or priorities
- Makes engagement extremely low-friction


---

## 45. The "Would You" Post


### Description

This post works because everyone wants to weigh in with their opinion. The trick is to find a real hot button that resonates with most people on LinkedIn, usually work-related.

### Example

```
If a company offered you a 10% pay cut, BUT allowed you to work from home on Fridays, would you take it?

```

### Template

```
If you could {{XXX}}, would it be {{XXX}} or {{XXX}}?

Personally, I would {{XXX}} because {{XXX}}. Now I am interested to hear your take on it.

I have heard countless arguments for each side, some saying {{XXX}} because {{XXX}} and others saying {{XXX}} because {{XXX}}.

Drop your comments below with your answer and be sure to explain why you picked it!

```

### How It Works

- Creates an engaging hypothetical scenario
- Offers a binary choice that's easy to respond to
- Shares your perspective to start the conversation
- Acknowledges multiple valid viewpoints
- Explicitly asks for reasoning, which drives deeper engagement

## 55. The "This vs That" Post


### Description

This is a simple but effective format that presents a binary choice and asks for opinions. It's a quick way to generate engagement on topics relevant to your industry.

### Example

```
A lousy job with a good boss is better than a good job with a lousy boss. Agree?

I was talking to a friend this weekend and they told me about this terrible experience they had at work.

They said to me, "My boss made a mistake on a project we were working on, and instead of owning his mistake, he said it was my fault. I sat through that meeting feeling shocked and disappointed. When we left the meeting, he told me, 'You are a good sport.' I knew I needed to start planning my exit strategy. I love my job, but I can't trust my boss."

It's demotivating being under a bad manager. I've had some bad bosses and it really makes a huge difference on "whom you work with" vs "what you work on" each day. I think a lousy job with a good boss and great co-workers is better than a good job with a lousy boss or co-workers who don't have your back.

## 61. The Question Strategy Post


### Description

This strategy works by asking the community a direct, thought-provoking question that invites multiple perspectives.

### Example

```
QUESTION: If your company asked you to work 10 hours a day vs "8 hrs", but said you can have ALL Fridays off so every week is 4-day work week would you say, "Yes" or "No" and why...?

What are the PROs and CONs of moving an organization to 4 day work week vs a 5-day work week...?

#hr #workweek #challengingthestatusquo #productivity

```

### Template

```
QUESTION: If {{XXX}} asked you to {{XXX}} vs {{XXX}}, but said {{XXX}}, would you say "Yes" or "No"?

As a follow-up, what is your argument for your answer? Why "Yes" or why "No"? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

```

### How It Works

- Creates immediate engagement with a clear, thought-provoking question
- Frames the question as a realistic professional scenario
- Encourages nuanced thinking beyond simple yes/no
- Often touches on current workplace trends or challenges
- Creates valuable discussion in the comments section

## 76. The Test a New Product Poll Strategy


### Description

This is a great strategy to test product-market fit with your LinkedIn audience before fully developing a new offering. It lets you validate demand before investing resources.

### Example

[Poll: Yes/No/Maybe, depends]

```

```

### How It Works
