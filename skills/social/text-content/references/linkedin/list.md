## 16. The "Things They Won't Teach You" Post


### Description

This post works well because everyone can relate to some kind of experience that didn't properly prepare them for reality. Revealing "hidden" or unconventional wisdom positions you as an insider sharing valuable secrets.

### Example

```
12 Things School Won't Teach You:
1. How to ask for raise.
2. How to cold call.
3. How to sell.
4. How to fire a person.
5. How to and when to hire.
6. How to invest your $.
7. How to stay mentally healthy.
8. How to interview and pick great candidates.
9. How to prospect for new clients without being a douche.
10. How to be grateful.
11. How to truly listen.
12.?

I need your help. ...what's number 12?
Comment it below!

```

### Template

```
{{number}} things {{XXX}} won't teach you

1.{{XXX}}
2.{{XXX}}
3.{{XXX}}
4. {{XXX}}

Any ideas for what number {{XXX}} should be??

```

### How It Works

- Challenges conventional education or training by highlighting its gaps
- Creates a list of practical, real-world skills that most people need
- Positions you as someone with insider knowledge
- Invites participation by asking for suggestions for the final item
- Appeals to people's desire for practical, applicable knowledge

## 18. The "Tips" Post


### Description

This works well when you can provide a really good insight or tip. It doesn't have to be a long post to have an impact, but it should provide clear, actionable value.

### Example

```
Here's the most important closing question every salesperson needs to ask every single time:

"Any reason you wouldn't make a purchase from us today?"

Share your top sales tip in the comments.

```

### Template

```
One of the biggest mistakes in {{business type}} is {{mistake}}.

Never do this. In doing this, you will {{tell them why it is a mistake}}.

Instead, {{tell them what they should do instead}}.

#hashtags

```

### How It Works

- Provides immediate, actionable value in a concise format
- Identifies a common mistake people make (creating recognition)
- Offers a better alternative solution
- Keeps it simple and focused on one specific tip
- Invites others to share their own tips, creating a resource in the comments

## 31. The "10 Ideas" Post


### Description

Everyone loves a good idea. The trick is to only write 8 or 9 of them and then let people come up with the last one, which drives engagement and participation.

### Example

```
10 ideas for dealing with stress this week (maybe more if you read the comments):

1. Spend time in nature - nothing beats a 20-minute walk through a forest.
2. Exercise - it's proven that exercise releases all the right chemicals to combat stress and depression.
3. Find a mentor - sometimes a few words from a wise and trusted person can get you pointed in the right direction.
4. Call a friend - sometimes just shooting the s*"t with your BFF is all that is needed.
5. Meditate - Stillness and silence (even for 5 mins) can recenter the busiest of people.
6. Know when to leave - Sometimes, taking a break is the best thing you can do.
7. Be grateful - Write down 3 things you are grateful for, it's hard to get upset when you are grateful
8. Volunteer - Go spend a couple of hours at your local homeless shelter and most of your problems and stress will melt away. All we need sometimes is perspective.
9. ????
10. ????

Help! I ran out of ideas.

What should # 9 and # 10 be?... or tell us which number is your go-to when you are feeling a little stressed in the comments.

I would love to hear your thoughts below!

Here are {{XXX}} things you can do this week to {{improve whatever problem is listed above}}

10. {{XXX}}
