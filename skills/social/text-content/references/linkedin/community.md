## 40. Let's Connect Post


### Description

This works because you give everyone permission to connect. It's what people secretly want - to expand their network - but they don't want to be spammy doing it. When you make the post explicitly about networking, everyone knows what it's about and people jump in.

### Example

```
LinkedIn is one of the best and easiest ways to network.

Let me show you how easy this is.

You can immediately grow your network in 3 very easy steps, right now!

Step 1 - Like this post.
Step 2 - Comment below if you're open to new connections. The first 100-200 people that comment get the most growth!
Step 3 - Send a personalized connection request to everyone that leaves a comment.

If you connect with me you get access to 25K new 2nds. Note! I only accept personalized connections. ;)

You'll have new conversations with like-minded folks who want to network with you.

Maybe you've heard about the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon before?
It doesn't even have to take 6 connections.
You are only 1 connection away from finding your next opportunity.

If you want to grow, then comment below to grow your network.

If you don't know what to say... just say... "I'm open to networking" or "LinkedIn rocks!"

It can't get any easier!

```

### Template

```
LinkedIn is the easiest platform to expand your network and make ideal connections. Here's how:

Step 1: {{XXX}}
Step 2: {{XXX}}
Step 3: {{XXX}}

That's it!

When you {{XXX}}, you gain {{XXX}}.

Comment below if {{XXX}}.

```

### How It Works

- Provides explicit permission to network (removing the awkwardness)
- Creates a structured process that feels safe and appropriate
- Offers immediate value (new connections)
- Makes networking feel easy and accessible
- Leverages the post's reach to connect multiple people

## 49. The "Why __________ Get Fired" Post


### Description

Getting fired is always a hot topic on LinkedIn. Creating a post around it tends to get engagement because it touches on fears and experiences many professionals share.

### Example

```
Why do clients fire their marketing agency?
Let me tell you Why.

I talk to 3-8 companies every day who are looking for a new marketing agency to help them with their marketing because the previous marketing agency dropped the ball with any one of these things:

1. Made a mistake and then didn't report on it up, so they lost total trust.
2. Made a mistake and didn't catch it because no one was looking at his or her account
3. Delivered different work then what was in the SOW.
4. Flat, down or little results.
5. Reporting contained no insights and no recommendations.
6. No innovation and no suggestions for new marketing ideas.
7. Low or zero communication.

I'm curious....what was the reason(s) you fired a marketing agency in the past...?

```

### Template

```
Getting fired is always a terrible experience.

Here's why {{XXX}} get fired:

1. Reason 1
2. Reason 2
3. Reason 3
4. Reason 4
5. Reason 5

I'm curious… What other reasons would {{XXX}} get fired…?
Leave it in the comments.

```

### How It Works

- Addresses a topic that creates immediate emotional response
- Provides valuable insights for avoiding negative outcomes
- Positions you as knowledgeable about industry standards
- Creates space for others to share their experiences
- Can help readers avoid making the same mistakes

## 64. Why We Should Connect Post


### Description

This post works because it directly addresses common objections to connecting with strangers on LinkedIn, reframing professional networking as a positive opportunity.

### Example

```
5 Reasons To Accept Connection Requests from Strangers:

1. This isn't Facebook. They're called "connections" not "friends".
2. You're building a professional network not a private golf club.
3. New connections bring new ideas from outside your social media echo chamber.
4. Your next client or supplier might come from a stranger's network.
5. Everyone you know, including your best friends, were once strangers.

Are you open to connect? Comment below.

## 69. The Mistake Post


### Description

Admitting mistakes makes you human and relatable. Showing how you learned from them demonstrates growth and values.

### Example

```
You can't ask if a candidate has kids.

I forgot that during an interview...

They paused, gave a weird look and said "no".

I forget people discriminate against parents.

Our team has 15 kids, 4 of them are mine.

We might show up after 9am drop off. We often leave at 5 for dinner. We might run if school calls...

But we do amazing work in between.

We don't succeed despite our families... We succeed because of them.

```

### Template

```
You can't {{XXX}}.

I forgot that during {{XXX}}.

I forget people {{XXX}} and that is why you can't do that.

Our team {{XXX}} and {{XXX}} and we support {{XXX}}.

```

### How It Works

- Creates vulnerability through admission of mistakes
- Demonstrates growth and learning
- Often addresses important ethical or legal considerations
- Shows your values in action, not just in theory
- Creates connection through shared human experiences

[Details about a giveaway and winners]

```
[GIVEAWAY ANNOUNCEMENT]

I'm giving away {{valuable item or service}} to {{number}} lucky people who:

## 78. Tell Someone's Else's Awesome Story Post


### Description

Sharing inspirational stories about others can be powerful and positioning. It demonstrates your values while avoiding seeming self-promotional.

### Example

```
The man on the left is Delonte West. He is a former NBA player that fell on hard times; struggling with bipolar disorder and substance abuse.

He earned around $16 million dollars during his playing career. Today he is homeless... scratch that. He WAS homeless. He was homeless until the man on the right heard about Delonte's plight.

The man on the right is Mark Cuban. He is currently worth 4.3 billion dollars. He heard that West had been seen panhandling at a gas station in the Dallas area. Cuban got in his car and searched him out. Cuban didn't send for someone to go get West, he went himself. He wanted to be certain that West got in the car; He wanted to make sure West would accept treatment - so he went to make the pitch himself.

You see, West played for Cuban's Dallas Mavericks and Cuban was just looking after one of his own. West, in fact, did get into Cuban's car and is on his way to recovering his life

Message:
1. Actions always speak louder than a checkbook.
2. When it's important enough, its personal.

```

### Template

```
[Tell an inspiring story about someone else]

[Explain how their actions demonstrate important values]

Key takeaways:
1. [First lesson from the story]
2. [Second lesson from the story]

□ $151,000-$200,000 (39%)
□ $201,000-$300,000 (39%)
□ Other (leave in the comments) (4%)

```
