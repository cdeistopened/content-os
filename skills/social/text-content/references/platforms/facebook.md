# Facebook - Platform Heuristics

## Success Heuristic

**Comments drive reach** - Facebook's algorithm rewards engagement, especially comments. The goal is to get people talking, not just liking.

Algorithm note: Facebook doesn't understand sentiment - angry comments boost the post as much as positive ones.

## Quick Specs

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Optimal length** | 40-140 characters |
| **Question posts** | 10-20 words max |
| **Hashtags** | NONE (Facebook doesn't reward them) |
| **Links** | NO in main post (kills reach) |
| **Voice** | Informal, playful, personable |

## What Works

### Content Types (Best Performers First)
1. **Question posts with background images** - BEST
2. **Text on colorful backgrounds** (native FB feature)
3. **Simple images with provocative captions**
4. **Engagement bait that invites response**

### Formats
- Questions (easy to answer, not rhetorical)
- "Fill in the blank" posts
- This or that choices
- Validation posts ("You're not alone if...")
- Text-on-background using native FB feature

### Text Heavy Sub-Formats
- iPhone notes style
- White text on black background
- Handwritten on graph paper / textured background
- Social media screenshot posts
- "Pop Quiz" format

## Anti-Patterns

- External links in main post (KILLS reach)
- Hashtags of any kind
- Too formal/corporate voice
- Long-form content (save for LinkedIn)
- Complex multi-step asks
- Arrow bullets - AI tell

---

## Voice

- Informal, playful, like talking to a friend
- Validation-heavy ("You're doing great")
- Simple, strong opinions that make you go "MHMMMM"
- Not a brand lecturing - a friend supporting

## OpenEd-Specific Notes

- **Audience:** Parents already in program (80% category, 20% program-specific)
- **Goal:** Validation, community, word-of-mouth
- **Tone:** "We get you" not "Here's what you should do"

Guideline from team:
> "Talk more to parents in the programs. Validate them, build trust. Keep them in our corner, sharing with friends saying, 'OpenEd gets me!'"

## Template Recommendations

From `references/templates/`:
- **One-liners** - Stop + Complaint, Values, Everyday Observations
- **Post structures** - Questions, Making Reader Feel Good, Validation

From `references/linkedin/`:
- **Engagement** - Agree/Disagree, Fill-in-blank, Crowdsource (adapt shorter)

---

## Link Strategy

Since external links kill reach:
1. Put link in first comment
2. Use "Link in comments" CTA in post
3. Or: Use Stories with link stickers for link-based content

*Note: Video posts use `short-form-video` skill instead.*
