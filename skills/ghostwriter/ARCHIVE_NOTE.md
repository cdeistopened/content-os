# Ghostwriter Archive Note

This skill is being archived as part of the writing skills refactor (2026-01-27).

## Unique Content to Preserve

The following content from `SKILL.md` should NOT be lost. It may work better as **personas/agents for Quality Loop** rather than a single skill:

### 1. The 8 Human Desires Framework

Useful for understanding reader motivation. Could be an evaluation persona.

1. **Safety of Tribe** - Belonging, community, fitting in
2. **Survival & Success** - Progress, achievement, security
3. **Life Enjoyment** - Pleasure, experiences, freedom
4. **Social Acceptance** - Status, respect, recognition
5. **Sexual Companionship** - Connection, attraction
6. **Comfort & Clarity** - Simplicity, ease, certainty
7. **Freedom From Fear** - Safety, protection
8. **Perceived Status** - Respect, authority, expertise

### 2. Voice Style Archetypes

These are orthogonal approaches that could function as different personas:

**Authentic Conversational Style**
- Direct, no-nonsense, contrarian
- "Everyone says X. They're wrong. Here's why."

**Analytical Enthusiasm Style**
- Enthusiastic about ideas, makes complex accessible
- "This is fascinating because..."

**Discovery by Deletion Style**
- Maximum impact per word, ruthless editing
- First draft 500 words → Final 200 with same impact

**Decision Framework Style**
- Reframes risk and decisions, asymmetric bets
- "The real question isn't X, it's Y"

### 3. Source Material Conversion Workflow

The 8-step workflow for converting transcripts/notes to prose. Could be a separate workflow skill or embedded in voice-wizard.

## Future Project: Quality Loop Personas

The above content might work as orthogonal evaluation personas:

- **Desire Evaluator**: "Which human desires does this tap into?"
- **Voice Adapter**: "Translate this into [Authentic/Analytical/Deletion/Decision] style"
- **Concision Editor**: "Apply Discovery by Deletion - cut 50% while keeping impact"

This is a separate project from the current skill refactor.

## What Happened to ghostwriter Functionality

- **Anti-AI patterns** → Moved to `writing-style` (always-invoke) and `human-writing` (on-demand)
- **SUCKS framework** → Moved to `human-writing`
- **Sticky sentences** → Moved to `human-writing`
- **Voice adaptation** → Now handled by self-contained voice skills
- **8 Desires + Archetypes** → Preserved here for future personas project
