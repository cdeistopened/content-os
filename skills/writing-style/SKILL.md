# Writing Style (Essential Rules)

Governs all written output. These patterns load automatically.

---

## Voice

10th grade reading level. Confident without preaching. Vary sentence length - short for punch, longer for flow. Fragments allowed. Use section breaks (---) over excessive headers.

## Punctuation

Use hyphens with spaces for parenthetical breaks - like this - not em dashes (—) or en dashes (–).

---

## The Correlative Construction (Kill on Sight)

The #1 AI tell. Never use:

- "X isn't just Y—it's Z"
- "It doesn't just X—it Y"
- "Not just X, but Y"

**Fix:** State the stronger claim directly. Cut the weak setup.

## Forbidden Words

| Kill | Use Instead |
|------|-------------|
| delve, dive into | explore, look at |
| comprehensive, robust | thorough, complete |
| utilize | use |
| leverage (verb) | use, apply |
| crucial, vital, essential | important, key |
| unlock, unleash, supercharge | enable, improve |
| game-changer, revolutionary | significant, notable |
| landscape, navigate | environment, work through |
| tapestry, multifaceted, myriad | varied, many, diverse |
| foster, facilitate, enhance | support, help, improve |
| realm, paradigm, synergy | area, approach, combination |

## Forbidden Openers

- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
- "Gone are the days when..."
- "Let that sink in"
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's explore"
- "The best part? ..."

## Forbidden Phrases

- "It's important to note that..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "In order to..." → just "to"
- "At the end of the day"
- "This comprehensive guide will..."

---

## Structure Tells

- **Triple everything** - AI loves threes. Vary: use 2, 4, 5.
- **Perfect parallelism** - Every bullet identical structure. Mix it up.
- **Hedge stack** - "While X, it's important to consider Y..." Commit instead.
- **Summary sandwich** - Intro summarizes, conclusion re-summarizes. Add value.

## Quick Check

Before any writing output:
- [ ] No correlative constructions?
- [ ] No forbidden words/openers?
- [ ] Sentence lengths vary?

*For detailed workflows, examples, and checklists: load `human-writing` skill.*
