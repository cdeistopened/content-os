## Example 1: Milestone & Community Focus
*Tone: Celebratory, Encouraging, Mission-Driven*

Greetings Eddies!

It just came to my attention that the OpenEd Daily hit a new milestone over the weekend: 20,000 subscribers!

Rather than resting on our laurels, we take this as a sign of the growing appetite for trustworthy content related to the opening up of education.

And so we're doubling down and upping our game, with a goal to reach hundreds of thousands of families with a message of encouragement (you've got this!) backed by carefully curated content.

I'd love to hear what kind of content you'd like to see more (or less) of: Deep dives? Homeschool tips? Curriculum/tool suggestions? Subject guides (math, science, etc.)? Memes?

See all the options and vote on Facebook.

Onward & upward,

## Example 2: Contrarian Philosophy (Science)
*Tone: Intellectual, Provocative, Quote-Heavy*

Science is the study of how the world works—it should be the most exciting subject of all. So why do so many students find it boring?

Adam Savage, the former MythBusters host, diagnosed the disconnect in our most viral social media videos of all time:

"When we teach kids that science and math and engineering are all things to memorize, we're missing the point. These are unfettered landscapes of the untried and the untested."

In an analogy that Ed the Horse would love, Savage reminds us that we call math and science "fields of knowledge" because they're open-ended—ripe for curious minds to explore.

At OpenEd, we've watched thousands of families rebuild their relationship with science. This week's deep dive gathers the most-loved recommendations from our teachers and families—tested, hands-on programs organized by type and grade level, honest trade-offs, and high-quality free resources. 

Stop trying to replicate the traditional science classroom when you can do something better.

## Example 3: Personal/Humorous (Social Media)
*Tone: Self-deprecating, Authentic, Fun*

Greetings Eddies!

Did you know that OpenEd is on Instagram (@openedHQ)? While I may not be able to compete with top-tier influencer homeschool moms, we're always looking for new ways to share the message that education is opening up (even if that means putting on a smelly latex horse mask and A/B testing silly gimmicks until we find something that sticks).

## Example 4: Data/Contrarian (Reading Levels)
*Tone: Urgent, Skeptical, Analytical*

Greetings!

An education expert recently published something that's making a lot of parents nervous. Chad Aldeman looked at data from 250,000 kids across 1,400 schools and concluded: if your child isn't reading on track by kindergarten, don't wait. Act fast. Every week you delay, he says, makes it harder for them to recover later.

The data he ushers sounds brutal, but is he interpreting it correctly?

Let's dive in.

## Example 5: Research/Intellectual Foundation
*Tone: Academic but Accessible, Questioning*

Greetings!

Peter Gray is a retired research psychologist who spent decades studying how children actually learn. His work has become the intellectual foundation for the Self-Directed Education movement, emphasizing how things like play are foundational to learning (especially at a young age).

In a recent Substack essay, he asks a puzzling question: If children come into the world biologically designed to educate themselves, then what are we doing for $16,000 per child per year on average?

Let's dive in.

## Example 6: Story/History (Alternative Paths)
*Tone: Narrative, Inspiring*

Greetings!

Ken Danford had spent six years teaching eighth-grade U.S. history in public school when a colleague handed him The Teenage Liberation Handbook.

In it, he found case studies of teens who left school and turned out... fine!

That was 1996. Danford quit his job, and ever since, he's been running North Star—a physical community center where teens can legally homeschool, connect with mentors, and rebuild their lives outside of compulsory classrooms. 

Let's dive in.

## Example 7: Myth-Busting/Community Story
*Tone: Reassuring, Direct*

Greetings!

Last week we shared Dave Hoffman's story—a public school administrator who unschooled all six kids.

He dispelled the myth about learning gaps among homeschoolers by pointing out the even larger gaps created by schools that breed conformity.

This week, a Reddit post offers something rare: an honest homeschooler sharing the real gaps they experienced. Plus, what makes you irreplaceable in an AI world, and why a 3D printer could be the solution to your screentime woes.

Let's dive in.

## Example 8: Relatable/Emotional (Homework)
*Tone: Empathetic, Viral-focused*

Welcome Eddies!

Homework: the very word strikes dread into your heart even decades after your last assignment (admit it).

Today, we unpack a viral Facebook post that shattered a thousand hearts with a single image of a 1st grader who had been overburdened with homework to the point of tears. Relatable?

## Example 9: Addressing Parental Anxiety
*Tone: Reassuring, Big Picture*

Greetings!

A few months ago, an OpenEd parent reached out with a familiar dilemma. Her student had done 9th grade on the diploma path, but she was switching to non-diploma-seeking status for more flexibility.

Yet she had still had some concerns. "I worry a lot about not following the traditional, earn a diploma and go to college path."

Society has pushed one linear path for so long: diploma → college → job → success.

Except that path is just one among many. This week, we came across a story that helps clarify the "diploma vs. no diploma" question.

Let's dive in.
