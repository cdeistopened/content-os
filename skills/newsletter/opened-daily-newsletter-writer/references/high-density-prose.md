# High-Density Prose

Pack meaning into flowing sentences. One thought, one container. Trust the reader.

## The Principle

Every sentence should carry meaning. If a sentence exists only to create dramatic space for the next sentence, cut it.

High-density prose assumes the reader can follow complex thoughts. It doesn't break ideas into fragments. It doesn't signal "now comes the important part" - it just delivers the important part.

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: The Study

**Low-density (bad):**
> A new MIT study just dropped.
>
> It claims LLM users "consistently underperform" on cognitive tests.
>
> AI doomers are obsessed with it.
>
> But here's the thing.
>
> None of them actually read the report.
>
> It turns out the study only had 18 students. They had 20 minutes. The prompts were boring SAT essays.

**High-density (good):**
> A new MIT study claims LLM users "consistently underperform" on cognitive tests - and AI doomers are obsessed. Of course, none of them read the 206-page report, which reveals 18 college students had 20 minutes to write essays based on boring SAT prompts using only ChatGPT.

**What changed:** Six units became one. "But here's the thing" disappeared. The substance (18 students, 20 minutes, boring prompts) undermines the panic - that's the insight, delivered in the flow, not after a dramatic pause.

### Example 2: The Funding News

**Low-density (bad):**
> Something big happened in AI last week.
>
> Mira Murati raised $2 billion.
>
> She's the former CTO of OpenAI.
>
> Her new company? Thinking Machines Lab.
>
> Here's the wild part.
>
> The company is only six months old. And from what I can tell, they don't even have a product yet.

**High-density (good):**
> Last week, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati raised $2 billion in seed funding for her stealth AI startup, Thinking Machines Lab, valuing the six-month-old company at around $10 billion with, from best I can tell, no product or business.

**What changed:** The setup ("Something big happened") is gone. The author's point of view ("from best I can tell, no product or business") is woven into the sentence, not saved for a reveal.

### Example 3: The Local Story

**Low-density (bad):**
> Here's a story about San Francisco.
>
> Patrick McCabe is an electrical engineer.
>
> He built an app called Solve SF.
>
> It lets people report issues like sidewalk poop in 10 seconds.
>
> That's way faster than the city's official app.
>
> But guess what?
>
> The city is about to shut it down.

**High-density (good):**
> Bay Area electrical engineer Patrick McCabe has created an app called Solve SF that allows city residents to file 311 reports about issues like poop on the sidewalk in as little as 10 seconds, far faster than the city's official 311 app. Unfortunately, because nice things are illegal in San Francisco, the city is about to effectively shut down Solve SF.

**What changed:** "Here's a story" and "But guess what?" are crutches. The high-density version delivers Patrick McCabe, what he built, how it works, and the problem - all in two sentences. The author's POV ("because nice things are illegal in San Francisco") lands harder because it's not telegraphed.

## Rhythm vs. Staccato

Short sentences are fine when they have rhythm:

> Take away their devices. Give them chores. Chalk. Challenges. You don't have to pay for your kids to play outside.

This sounds like someone talking - listing things off, building momentum.

Short sentences are NOT fine when they're dramatic pauses:

> Schools aren't working. Not anymore. Not for most kids. And here's why.

This is staccato-for-emphasis. Each fragment exists to create dramatic space. The meaning could be delivered in one sentence: "Schools aren't working for most kids anymore."

**The test:** Does the short sentence carry meaning, or create a pause before meaning?

## Setup Phrases to Eliminate

These signal "the important part is coming" instead of just delivering it:

- "Here's the thing..."
- "But here's the kicker..."
- "The clever part:"
- "What's interesting:"
- "Here's why that matters..."
- "Let that sink in."
- "And that's the point."

If you need to tell the reader something is important, it probably isn't. Important things land on their own.

## One Paragraph Per Section

For newsletter segments (THOUGHT, TREND, TOOL), default to one paragraph per section. Natural breaks between distinct thoughts are fine, but resist the urge to fragment for emphasis.

A 100-word paragraph that flows is better than five 20-word fragments that perform.

## The Test

Read it aloud. Does it sound like someone thinking through an idea? Or someone performing "good writing"?

High-density prose sounds like thinking. Low-density prose sounds like presenting.
