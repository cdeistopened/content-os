# OpenEd Daily Style Guide: Ranked Examples

Analysis of 288 newsletters distilled into archetypes with concrete examples. Use alongside SKILL.md.

---

## Edition Types

### TYPE A: Integrated Edition
All three segments orbit a single theme. The newsletter reads as one cohesive argument.

**Example:** #085 - "The old man who outsmarted his bullies"
- THOUGHT: Old man story (bullying → creative problem-solving)
- TREND: Report on bullying data  
- TOOL: Resource that helps with the theme

**When to use:** When you have one strong anchor piece that naturally connects to supporting content.

### TYPE B: Modular Edition
Segments stand alone, connected only by newsletter identity and voice.

**Example:** A typical Monday edition
- THOUGHT: Learning science insight
- TREND: ESA policy news from Texas
- TOOL: Unrelated productivity app

**When to use:** When you have three strong standalone pieces that don't naturally connect. Don't force integration.

## THOUGHT Archetypes (5 types)

### 1. THE PARABLE (Best performer)
A story with embedded lesson. Reader discovers the insight through narrative, not lecture.

**Gold standard:** #085 - "The old man who outsmarted his bullies"
> An old man lived alone. One day, local kids start throwing rocks at his house. Instead of yelling, he offers them a dollar each to come back tomorrow. They do. Next day, fifty cents. Then a quarter. Finally, he says he can't afford to pay them anymore. The kids, now feeling underpaid, never return.

**Why it works:**
- Story first, insight second (reader figures it out)
- Subverts expectations (paying bullies?)
- Memorable and shareable
- No preaching required

**Pattern:** [Surprising situation] → [Counterintuitive action] → [Unexpected resolution] → [Reader draws conclusion]

### 2. THE VIVID ANALOGY
Maps education concepts onto familiar objects/experiences.

**Gold standard:** "Homeschooling doesn't mean what it used to"
> Homeschooling used to mean a specific thing. Now it's like 'cable' - a bundle of options (co-ops, pods, tutors, online courses) that you assemble yourself.

**Why it works:**
- Concrete image (cable bundle)
- Acknowledges evolution without lecturing
- Reader immediately "gets it"

**Pattern:** [Old understanding] → [New reality] → [Clarifying metaphor]

### 3. THE SUBVERSIVE REFRAME
Concede the conventional view, then flip it.

**Gold standard:** "Protecting the Internal Spark"
> Schools say they're preparing kids for the real world. But Ansel Adams's mother pulled him OUT of school precisely because the real world - nature, exploration, self-direction - couldn't be found inside one.

**Why it works:**
- Appears to agree initially
- Historical credibility (famous person)
- Reader discovers the flip

**Pattern:** [Acknowledge common belief] → [Historical/concrete example that subverts it] → [New frame]

### 4. THE GUT-PUNCH QUOTE
Let someone else deliver the insight. Your job is curation and framing.

**Example:** "'Mommy, did you get distracted too?'"
> A mother shares her child's question: "Mommy, did you get distracted too?" after being pulled from traditional school. The question reframes everything.

**Why it works:**
- Raw, unfiltered voice
- Child's perspective disarms defenses
- You're not preaching - someone else said it

**Pattern:** [Brief setup] → [Powerful quote] → [Let it land without over-explaining]

### 5. THE ONE-LINER
Single sentence that reframes everything. Rare, but devastating when done right.

**Example:** "Education isn't filling a bucket. It's lighting a fire."

**When to use:** Only when you find genuine gold. Don't manufacture these.

## TREND Archetypes (4 types)

### 1. ALARMING STAT + HUMAN VOICE
Data creates urgency; human story creates connection.

**Example:** "83% of parents say..."
> 83% of parents believe schools aren't preparing kids for the AI economy. But talk to Maria Gonzales in Houston, and it's not abstract: "My son's math teacher spent three months on a unit the Khan Academy covered in two weeks."

**Why it works:**
- Number provides credibility
- Name and location create specificity
- Quote grounds the stat in reality

**Pattern:** [Stat] → [Named person + location] → [Direct quote]

### 2. FOLLOW THE SMART MONEY
What are sophisticated actors (VCs, wealthy families, tech executives) actually doing?

**Example:** "Silicon Valley's education secret is leaking"
> When you hear what Google executives are doing with their own kids' education, it makes you wonder what they know that they're not telling us.

**Why it works:**
- Social proof from high-status sources
- Creates curiosity gap
- Readers want to know the "secret"

**Pattern:** [High-status group] + [Surprising behavior] → [Implication]

### 3. HISTORICAL PARALLEL
Today's trend isn't new - map it onto past movements.

**Example:** Comparing homeschool growth to early charter movement

**Why it works:**
- Provides perspective
- Makes current moment feel like part of larger story
- Readers love "history rhyming"

**Pattern:** [Current trend] → [Historical parallel] → [What happened then] → [What it suggests now]

### 4. CONCRETE CASE STUDY
One family, one school, one district - told in detail.

**Example:** "For this family, hybrid means..."
> The Johnsons in Tampa have three kids in three different arrangements: one full-time homeschool, one hybrid with the district, one in a microschool. Here's how they make it work.

**Why it works:**
- Specificity creates credibility
- Readers can see themselves
- Actionable details

**Pattern:** [Family/school name] + [Location] + [Specific arrangement] + [How/why]

---

## TOOL Archetypes (4 types)

### 1. HOW-TO IN DISGUISE
Don't describe the tool - show how to use it for a specific outcome.

**Good:** "Open your state's ESA application portal. Click 'Account Setup.' Before you fill in anything, do this first..."

**Bad:** "The ESA application portal is a useful resource for families seeking educational freedom."

**Pattern:** [Immediate action verb] + [Specific first step] + [One useful tip]

### 2. PERSONAL ENDORSEMENT
You (or a named source) vouch for it from experience.

**Example:** "I've tried every transcript tool. This is the only one I still use three months later."

**Why it works:**
- Cuts through noise
- Trust transfer from endorser
- Implies extensive testing

**Pattern:** [Credibility statement] + [Specific endorsement] + [Why it stuck]

### 3. PROBLEM-SOLUTION FRAME
Name the pain point first, then introduce the tool as relief.

**Example:** "Tracking learning across three different platforms is a nightmare. Until you discover [Tool], which..."

**Why it works:**
- Reader self-selects (do I have this problem?)
- Tool becomes the hero
- Clear value proposition

**Pattern:** [Specific pain point] + [Tool introduction] + [How it solves it]

### 4. "WE TRIED THIS" ENDORSEMENT
Team/community validation.

**Example:** "Three of our team members ran their curriculum through [Tool] last month. Here's what they found..."

**Why it works:**
- Multiple data points
- Feels like insider knowledge
- More credible than single endorsement

**Pattern:** [Group who tried it] + [Results/findings] + [Recommendation]

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

### FORCED CHEERFULNESS
**Bad:** "TGIF Eddies! Hope your week was AMAZING!"

### THE SETUP-PAYOFF CRUTCH
**Bad:** "The clever part: [explanation]"
**Bad:** "The classic study: [description]"
**Better:** Just write naturally. Remove the colon and the label.
