# Parting Thought Example

## Source
OpenEd Weekly Newsletter, Week of October 31, 2025

## Format (2-3 paragraphs with closing reflection)

---

Ken Danford asks struggling students a simple question: "Have you considered not going?"

It sounds radical. But what's actually radical is assuming the current system works for everyone. What's actually radical is thinking a teenager needs permission to choose how to spend their time.

The infrastructure exists now. North Star. Liberated Learners. Tutoring. Microschools. Hybrid models. Mentorship networks. A thousand different ways to learn that aren't "public school or homeschool alone."

Your kid doesn't need you to be a certified teacher. They need you to listen when they say something hurts. They need you to ask: "What if there's another way?"

Ken spent 30 years proving there is.

## Instructions for This Section

**Purpose:** Tie the week's themes together with a closing thought. Leave readers with a question, reflection, or action invitation that resonates.

**Structure:**
1. **Opening** (1 sentence): A question or quote that anchors the week's themes
2. **Expansion** (2-3 sentences): Why this question/quote matters. What's the larger implication?
3. **Grounding** (1-2 sentences): What exists now? What's possible?
4. **Personal invitation** (1-2 sentences): What does the reader need to do/think/feel?
5. **Closing** (1 sentence): Strong, memorable finishing statement

**Tone:**
- Reflective but actionable
- Universal but personal
- Hopeful without being naive
- Calls readers to something greater than themselves

**Length:** 2-3 paragraphs (roughly 100-150 words)

**Format Examples:**

**Opening with a question:**
`[Guest/Theme] asks [question that defines the week].`

**Opening with observation:**
`It sounds [emotional reaction]. But what's actually [reframe] is [insight].`

**Expansion pattern:**
`The [premise]. The [data/evidence]. The [implication].`

**Grounding pattern:**
`The infrastructure exists now. [List examples]. [Unifying statement].`

**Personal invitation:**
`Your [audience] doesn't need you to be [old expectation]. They need you to [new action/mindset].`

**Closing:**
`[Name/pronoun] spent [timeframe] proving [central insight].`

**Key Characteristics:**
- Ties back to main podcast/guest (Ken Danford)

- Lists concrete examples to make point real
- Addresses reader directly ("Your kid doesn't need...")
- Ends with evidence/proof (Ken's 30 years)
- Tone is warm, empowering, slightly provocative

**What makes a strong parting thought:**
- It echoes the week's central insight
- It reframes what seems impossible as possible
- It invites reader reflection ("What if...")
- It acknowledges both struggle and hope
- It creates a clear call-to-action or mindset shift

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't summarize the week (that's not the point)
- Don't list every section's content
- Don't end on a flat or obvious note
- Don't make it preachy without action
- Don't lose the human voice/warmth
