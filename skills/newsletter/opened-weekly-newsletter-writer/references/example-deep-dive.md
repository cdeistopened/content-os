Andrea Fife was 36 when her doctor confirmed what everyone apparently already knew: she had ADHD. Her oldest son was diagnosed at 8. Her youngest showed a completely different presentation—also ADHD. Understanding these different presentations changed how she approached parenting entirely.

Most people think ADHD is about not having *enough* attention. They're wrong. It's about not having *control* over where your attention goes. It's like having 50 channels on the TV and someone else controlling the remote. The prefrontal cortex—the part that controls executive function—is where the real issue lives.

**Kids with ADHD are on average 30% behind their peers in executive function.** A 12-year-old has the executive function of an 8-year-old. By 18, heading to college, they still have the executive function of someone just starting middle school.

So when your ADHD kid hyperfocuses for six hours on Minecraft but can't focus six minutes on math homework, you might stop and consider that it's not laziness. It's their neurology.

The silver lining: homeschooling becomes a superpower the moment you realize nothing is locked in. If it's not working, you can change it.
