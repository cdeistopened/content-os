## Step 3: Actual Twitter Thread - Nov 14, 2025

### TWEET 1 (Opening Hook)
```
🐎 Ed's Roundup: The most clicked education links from this week 🐎

Here's what 20K+ readers of OpenEd Weekly are paying attention to.

13 creators. 1 thread. Let's go.

(thread)
```

**Analysis:**
- Opens with brand identifier: "Ed's Roundup"
- States clear value: "most clicked"
- Audience size signaling: "20K+ readers"
- Horse emoji (brand tie-in)
- Clear thread opener: "(thread)"

---

### TWEET 2 (First Creator - Adam Savage)
```
First up, @AdamSavage of MythBusters diagnoses why science class fails kids:

"When we teach science as memorization, we're missing the point."

Wonder > Worksheets

Here's our recommendations for the best homeschool science curricula: https://opened.co/blog/best-homeschool-science-curriculum
```

**Structure Used:** Direct Quote + Contrast
**Why it works:**
- Opens with credible name (@AdamSavage)
- Uses direct quote (stops scroll)
- Simple contrast: Wonder vs Worksheets
- Link to OpenEd content (not external blog)
- Teasable/shareable insight

---

### TWEET 3 (Second Creator - Dr. Amy Moore)
```
A psychologist explains why kids listen less the louder you yell.

Full conversation: https://opened.co/blog/why-your-adhd-kid-wont-listen-its-not-what-you-think

Learn more at @LearningRx
```

**Structure Used:** Problem Recognition + Solution + Partnership Tag
**Why it works:**
- Opens with problem parents experience
- Counterintuitive hook (louder = less listening)
- Direct link to podcast
- Natural LearningRx partnership mention
- Short, punchy format

---

### TWEET 4 (Third Creator - Austin Scholar)
```
Hat tip to @flowidealism for finding this research on the most common way that schools (and parents) kill their kids' curiosity.

https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-190-why-school-kills
```

**Structure Used:** Attribution + Expert Find
**Why it works:**
- Credits the creator directly
- "Hat tip" language = authentic curation
- Extends problem to parents (not just schools)
- Links to Austin Scholar's original post
- Positions OpenEd as curator, not originator

---

### TWEET 5 (Fourth Creator - Rebel Educator)
```
We're guessing this visualization of homeschool growth state by state since 2017 comes from the @NYTimes because who else puts a hyphen in the word "home-school"?

Judging by the color scheme, the chart maker seems alarmed by whatever's happening in NY and DC.
```

**Structure Used:** Observation + Humor + Data Point
**Why it works:**
- Uses humor (hyphenation joke)
- Makes an observation about methodology
- Implies data without stating it
- Creates curiosity (what's the color scheme?)
- Personality-driven curation

---

### TWEET 6 (Fifth Creator - Henrik Wes)
```
Cold email is the new resume.

All the cool kids are doing it, says @Henrik_wes

I've met multiple 15-17 year olds who've come further in life than 99% of university graduates.

The one pattern: they cold email EVERYONE
```

**Structure Used:** Trend + Supporting Quote
**Why it works:**
- Opens with contrarian headline
- Tags the creator
- Includes quote-tweet for credibility
- Includes original tweet metadata
- Educational insight + career advice angle

---

### TWEET 7 (Sixth Creator - Charlotte Mason / Simply Charlotte Mason)
```
Unpopular opinion: Grade levels are based on a factory model, not childhood development.

Teach the CHILD not the Grade Level.

(Okay fine this is now a popular opinion and Charlotte Mason knew this 100+ years ago)

https://simplycharlottemason.com/blog/teach-your-child-not-a-grade-level
```

**Structure Used:** Contrarian Take + Historical Credibility
**Why it works:**
- Starts with "unpopular opinion" hook
- Clear contrast: factory model vs development
- Self-aware humor ("okay fine this is popular now")
- Credits source (Charlotte Mason)
- Invites agreement/engagement

---
