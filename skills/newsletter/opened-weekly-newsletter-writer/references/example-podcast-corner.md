# PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: [Find Your North Star](https://youtu.be/QYZfPxPan8E)

Thirty years ago, Ken Danford read a book that convinced him teens who leave school turn out fine. So he quit teaching and started [North Star](https://northstarteens.org/).

When a struggling student comes to Ken, he asks them a provocative question: *"Have you considered not going?"*

For many, this is their first time hearing that such a possibility exists.

Next, Ken offers them a kind of guided off-ramp into their own dream-version of homeschooling + real-world learning, via his Liberated Learners network. The network now includes campuses in New York, Virginia, Oregon, Texas and the UK.

Across the world, kids and their parents are realizing that they have more options than they realize.
