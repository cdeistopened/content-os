Happy Halloween to the costumed candy collectors. And if you're not dressing up, well... happy Friday.

Before we dive into this week's goodies, I want to point out that Daylight Computer is running a special sale—today only—on their Daylight Kids bundle, which includes their kid-friendly tablet, case, and stylus. If your child is sensitive to screens, you might consider it as a Chromebook/iPad alternative. (Full disclosure: It's the only device I let my 5-year-old use!)

I'm also excited to announce the OpenEd Daily's first ever giveaway for subscribers of this same bundle ($729 value).

Here's how it works:

1. **Enter the giveaway here.**
2. **Reply and refer:** Hit reply on this email, and cc: up to 5 friends who are exploring a more open education.
3. **Earn bonus entries:** For each person you refer who fills out the form, you'll earn an additional entry. And based on the typical reply rate to these emails (*crickets*) your odds are good if you actually do this!

As a bonus, all entrants get our guide to getting academics done in less time using a customized combo of learning apps + the Daylight device.

If you know a family in AR, KS, IN, IA, MN, MT, NV, OR or UT considering a different approach to their child's education, this is a great opportunity to invite them to apply for mid-year enrollment before the November 10 deadline. Even if they're not ready, maybe this email will show them that a better way is possible, and give them a shot at winning the giveaway.

Reply, cc:, and plant the seed!

Now let's dive in.
