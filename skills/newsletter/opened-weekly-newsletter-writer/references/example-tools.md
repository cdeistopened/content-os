# TOOLS WE'RE BOOKMARKING

[**SALE: Daylight Kids Bundle**](https://daylight.computer/) — A screen that doesn't flicker or emit the blue light that wires kids up. Works as tablet, e-reader, notetaker, or light laptop replacement. Ideal for the kid who gets tantrums from screen time.

[**Primer**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.humanprogram.primer&pli=1) — This app adapts to what your kid knows before moving them forward. Covers hundreds of topics in multiple languages. (Google Play)

[**No Yell November**](https://www.coachmegthomas.com/what-is-mamas-members) — Coach Meg Thomas's 30-day challenge for members. (note: it's about regulating *your* nervous system, not controlling your kids.)

[**Focus Timer Videos**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuiF-_3Cj51fQeIJ9IliMbg) — Free visual countdown timers set to calm music with gentle alarms. The middle school teacher behind the YouTube channel keeps adding them based on what families request.

## Instructions for This Section

**Purpose:** Curate 10-15 practical tools, apps, products, and resources that readers can use immediately. Mix of free and paid, digital and physical.

**Structure for Each Item:**
1. **Tool Name** (hyperlinked): Make it clickable
2. **Benefit-first description** (1-2 sentences): Lead with what it DOES, not what it IS
3. **Source attribution** (parentheses): Where we found it or who recommends it

**Critical Rules:**
- NO category grouping (list sequentially, not by type)
- Lead with BENEFIT, not features
- Include price/cost when relevant (free, $4-5, optional premium)
- Always include source attribution in parentheses
- Write to earn the click: hint at value without explaining everything
- Use Pirate Wires tone: observational, slightly irreverent, human

**Tone Guidelines:**
- "A screen that doesn't flicker" (benefit) not "Has flicker-free display"
- "Kid now designs and paints models 1-2 hours daily instead of scrolling" (specific outcome) not "Redirects screen time"
- "Regulating *your* nervous system" (honest note) not "Parenting challenge"
- "Kid-tested curriculum win" (real-world proof) not "Educational resource"

**Format Examples:**

**With single source:**
`[**Tool Name**](URL) — Benefit description. (Source Name)`

**With multiple links:**
`[**Tool Name**](URL) — Benefit description. ([Secondary Link](URL)) (Source Name)`

**For non-digital:**
`**Tool Name** — Benefit description. (Source Name)`

**Length:** 1-2 sentences per tool + source

**Source Attribution Styles:**
- Person: `(via Andrea Fife)` - when recommended by someone featured
- Platform: `(Reddit)`, `(Google Play)` - when sourced from platform
- Organization: `(Home-Centered Learning)`, `(Abeka)` - when from a creator
- Mixed: `(Rick Hess, AEI)` - when author and publication both matter

**Key Characteristics:**
- Mixes free tools (Focus Timer, Fall Wordsearch) with paid (Daylight, Primer)
- Includes tech (Habitica, 3D printer) alongside physical (printables, skeleton model)
- Real-world stories (one parent bought printer thinking..., turned textbook chore...)
- Specific recommendations (Staples $4-5, 1-2 hours daily, etc.)
- No category grouping—flows naturally from one to next
- Every item has clear source attribution
- Benefits lead (not features)
- Tone is personal, honest, slightly irreverent
