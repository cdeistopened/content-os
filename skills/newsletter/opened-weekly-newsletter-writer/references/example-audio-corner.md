## Instructions for This Section

**Purpose:** Curate 5+ audio/video content (NOT the main podcast). Create a separate listening section for busy readers who prefer audio. Make each recommendation sound compelling enough to earn a click.

**Structure for Each Item:**
1. **Title** (hyperlinked): Episode or video title
2. **Teaser description** (1-2 sentences): What's the insight/moment? Why should someone listen?
3. **Source attribution** (parentheses): Podcast name or creator

**Critical Rules:**
- This is SEPARATE from Podcast Corner (main featured episode)
- Focus on curated audio/video content the audience should know about
- Write teasers that make people WANT to listen, not summaries
- Use Pirate Wires tone: provocative, observational, honest
- Each item must earn the click through intrigue, not full explanation
- Include 5+ recommendations minimum

**Tone Guidelines:**
- "A generation of educators believed something...that was proven wrong decades ago" (creates curiosity)
- "You're just buying groceries and suddenly defending your entire educational philosophy" (relatable, human moment)
- "What it's like living with ADHD in traditional school" (specific angle, not generic)
- "Why devices are designed to be addictive—and why he built something different" (tension, contrast)

**Format Examples:**

**Standard format:**
`[**Title**](URL) — Teaser description that makes you curious. (Source Name)`

**With attribution to person:**
`[**Title**](URL) — [Guest Name], [Title], shares [specific insight]. (Source Podcast)`

**With organization reference:**
`[**Title**](URL) — Explores [topic] from the perspective of [angle]. (Organization Name)`

**Length:** 1-2 sentences per recommendation + source

**Source Attribution:**
- Podcast name: `(APM Reports)`, `(OpenEd Podcast)`
- Creator/platform: `(Christy Faith)`, `(YouTube)`
- Mixed: `(Ben Somers, OpenEd Podcast)` when person matters

**Key Characteristics:**
- Mix of external (APM Reports, Christy Faith) and internal (OpenEd Podcast) recommendations
- Each has a specific angle (ADHD medication, defending homeschool, device addiction)
- Teasers use relatable moments ("buying groceries", "living with ADHD")
- Focus on perspectives/insights, not just topics
- All write to make listener think "I need to hear this"
- Titles hyperlinked for easy access
- Source always attributed
- Tone stays consistent: observational, slightly provocative, human-centered

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't summarize the whole episode
- Don't explain the conclusion
- Don't make it about features ("This podcast has great production")
- Don't miss the human angle (find the personal story or insight)
