## Common Mistakes

1. **Keyword stuffing**: If you're forcing the keyword in, you've gone too far
2. **Weak hook**: First paragraph must grab attention immediately
3. **Generic content**: Every article needs proprietary OpenEd insights
4. **Poor internal linking**: Link to hub pages and cornerstone content, not just homepage
5. **Boring meta description**: This is your search result sales pitch
6. **Ignoring search intent**: Match content to what searchers actually want
7. **No CTA**: Every article should guide readers toward OpenEd
8. **AI voice**: Run scrubber and manually check for forbidden phrases
9. **Too academic**: 8th-10th grade reading level, not college dissertation
10. **No FAQ section**: Missing easy featured snippet opportunity
