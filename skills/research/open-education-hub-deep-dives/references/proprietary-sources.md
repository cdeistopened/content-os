## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Internal Search
Before external research:
1. Search podcast transcripts for topic keywords
2. Check newsletter archive for previous coverage
3. Search Slack for teacher discussions
4. Check for relevant ambassador interviews

### Step 2: Extract Quotes
Create a quote bank for the article:
- 2-3 strong podcast quotes minimum
- Teacher insights where relevant
- Parent experience quotes if available

### Step 3: Gap Analysis
Identify what's missing:
- Statistics needing external sources
- Legal information needing verification
- Curriculum details needing research
- Influencer perspectives to include

### Step 4: External Research
Fill gaps with:

- HSLDA for legal information
- Influencer blogs/podcasts for additional perspectives
- Academic sources for claims needing backup

## Quote Integration Best Practices

### DO
- Attribute with name, role, and source
- Include context for the quote
- Let quotes carry emotional weight
- Use quotes to break up dense information
- Choose quotes with specific details

### DON'T
- Stack multiple quotes back-to-back
- Use quotes for generic statements
- Force quotes into sections where they don't fit
- Over-attribute (once per quote is enough)
- Edit quotes to change meaning

### Format Examples

**Podcast quote:**
```
"[Quote here]"

— [Name], [role], on the [OpenEd Podcast](link)
```

**Teacher quote:**
```
As OpenEd teacher [Name] explains: "[Quote here]"
```

**Parent quote:**
```
[Name], a homeschool mom of [number] in [State], puts it simply: "[Quote here]"
```
