# Sarah: OpenEd's One True Fan

## Who She Is

Sarah is a stay-at-home mom in her mid-30s to mid-40s, living in a suburban area of a state like Utah or Oregon. She leans conservative, possibly LDS or Christian, with a bit of that "crunchy" sensibility - she cares about natural living, whole foods, being intentional about what her family consumes and how they spend their time.

She has 2-3 kids, and at least one has unique learning needs - maybe ADHD, dyslexia, anxiety, or just a kid who doesn't fit the traditional classroom mold. She's been a stay-at-home mom for years. She's not a former corporate professional stepping away from a career; she's someone who's been in the home, raising her kids, and now taking on educational responsibility without formal teaching training.

## Her Current Situation

Sarah is either already homeschooling or seriously considering it. If she's already homeschooling, she's looking for support, community, curriculum guidance, or funding she didn't know existed. If she's on the fence, she's frustrated with her kid's school experience and curious about homeschooling but intimidated by the idea of doing it all herself.

She's not an expert teacher. She's a mom trying to match the best resources to her kids' needs. She spends time on Facebook groups and Google searches, reading curriculum reviews, trying to figure out what other families are doing. She wants social proof from people she trusts - not another review from a stranger, but what the mom down the street is using, what's working in her homeschool co-op, what her sister-in-law tried with her struggling reader.

The paradox: she has access to more resources than any generation of homeschoolers ever, but that abundance creates paralysis. Every curriculum has glowing reviews somewhere. Every approach has passionate advocates. She's left wondering if she's missing something everyone else seems to have figured out.

## The Tension She Lives With

Sarah holds two things at once, and they don't always fit together comfortably.

On one side: a beautiful vision of what homeschooling could be. Kids learning at their own pace. Curiosity-driven education. Family closeness. Time in nature. Reading aloud on the couch. The Instagram version of homeschooling.

On the other side: the messy reality. A kid who won't sit still. Another who's behind in reading. Days that fall apart by 10am. Constant doubt about whether she's doing enough or doing the right things.

She's torn between the idealized view and the actual challenges of her actual kids.

## What Keeps Her Up at Night

The fears underneath the practical concerns:

- Am I screwing up my kids' socialization?
- Why am I taking on all this extra work?
- Will my kids be prepared for the future?
- Am I giving them the best education possible?
- What will people think? (Though this one is fading as homeschooling becomes higher status - she might even feel a little proud of going against the grain)

The deeper fear: What if I'm the bottleneck? What if my limitations as a non-teacher are holding my kids back?

## What She's Tried

She's probably experimented with different curricula, bought programs that didn't stick, tried approaches that worked for other families but not hers. She's aware there are different philosophies - Charlotte Mason, classical, unschooling, Montessori - but she hasn't planted a flag in any one camp. She might feel pressure to pick a lane and become a "Charlotte Mason mom" or a "classical education family," but none of them feel like a perfect fit.

## What She Actually Needs

Practical needs:
- Curriculum that fits her specific kids (not just highly-rated in general)
- Funding to afford quality resources
- Teacher support for subjects she can't handle
- Community of families doing this alongside her
- Confidence that she's on the right track

Emotional needs:
- Permission to mix and match approaches without guilt
- Validation that she knows her kids better than any system
- Relief from the pressure to be everything
- Assurance that alternative paths lead to real futures

## What Success Looks Like

Six months to a year after engaging with OpenEd:

- Homeschooling feels smoother, less like a daily battle
- She's confident in the curriculum she's chosen
- Her kids are advancing through subjects they previously struggled with
- She found the right resources and stopped second-guessing every choice
- She has a community of like-minded families
- The daily friction has decreased
- She's not lying awake wondering if she's ruining her kids

## How She Finds OpenEd

Sarah likely encounters OpenEd through the public-facing content first - the OpenEd Daily newsletter, a podcast episode, a social post that resonates. She starts to trust the voice and philosophy. At some point, she discovers there's an actual program she could enroll in.

The funding is the practical hook that gets her in the door. But the identity, community, and philosophy are what make her stay and become an advocate.

## Why OpenEd Works for Her

OpenEd removes the biggest mental barriers:
- "I'm not a teacher" - OpenEd provides actual teachers to guide her kids
- "I can't afford quality resources" - OpenEd provides funding
- "I don't know where to start" - OpenEd has a marketplace and curriculum guidance
- "I'm doing this alone" - OpenEd offers community

The philosophical fit: OpenEd's message is that she doesn't have to pick one educational tribe. She can take what works from Charlotte Mason, grab a math curriculum from somewhere else, let her kinesthetic learner do something entirely different. She can mix and match without guilt. Her family's education should look like her family.

## The Transformation

From: Overwhelmed mom drowning in curriculum options, unsure if she's qualified, worried she's failing her kids, isolated in her homeschool journey

To: Confident educational designer who knows her kids, has the resources and support she needs, belongs to a community of like-minded families, and sees her children thriving in ways they never did in traditional school

## Writing to Sarah

When creating content for Sarah, remember:

- She's not looking for another expert to tell her what to do. She wants to feel capable.
- She responds to stories of other moms like her, not credentials and statistics.
- She's skeptical of anything that sounds too polished or too good to be true.
- She wants permission and practical guidance, not ideology.
- She's tired. Don't add to her overwhelm.
- Speak to her fears directly but don't dwell in them - show the path through.
- Celebrate the messy reality, not just the Instagram version.
- She already senses that her kids deserve something different. You're confirming what she already knows.
