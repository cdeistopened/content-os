## What is Open Education?

## **Why Now: The World Has Changed**

Technology has transformed virtually every aspect of our lives, giving us unprecedented personalization, flexibility, and access. We can work from anywhere, customize our entertainment, and connect globally. Yet education remains largely stuck in an industrial-era model.

### **From Closed Education to Open Education**

## **The Movement Is Growing**

* Parent satisfaction with traditional U.S. education has dropped to a 25-year low of 42% (Gallup)  
* Homeschooling has nearly doubled in the last five years  
* Microschools, learning pods, and hybrid schooling have doubled in the last decade  
* Students with open approaches to education demonstrate better outcomes:  
  * 74% of alt/homeschool graduates had taken college classes, compared to only 46% of conventionally schooled graduates  
  * Higher college GPAs than conventionally schooled students  
  * 33% more likely to engage in volunteer activities  
  * Consistently higher scores on tests of academic skills across most studies

## **Common Challenges in Making the Shift**

Parents and families want to embrace educational freedom but worry about:

* Choosing the wrong approach  
* Potential isolation  
* Excessive screen time  
* The insecurity of parental failure

## **Our Vision: A World of Open Education**

We envision a world where:

* Families don't have to pick from one pre-defined approach  
* Learners blend real-world connection with the flexibility of digital  
* Technology and entrepreneurship are embraced and wielded for good  
* Every individual develops independence and the ability to solve the biggest problems in the world

## **Our Definition**

**Open education is the recognition that each student is unique and the world is full of possibility.**

Rather than being forced to pick between public/private, remote/on-site, part-time/full-time, large school/small school, homeschool/unschool, or any other approach, open education allows learners to take what works from any of them and adapt it to their goals.

It opens every parent and student to whatever combination of resources and methods they need, when and how they need them.

## **Our Promise**

OpenEd exists to make this vision accessible to all families, regardless of background, location, or financial resources. We provide:

* A supportive community of like-minded families  
* Expert guidance through the transition  
* Curated educational resources that blend the best of all approaches  
* Flexible models that adapt to each family's needs  
* Tools to build confidence in educational decision-making

**The future of education isn't closed—it's open. And it's already here.**

### **What We Stand For (FAD: For)**

**Our core beliefs that differentiate us:**

1. **Parents know their children better than any system or expert** \- We believe the traditional education system wrongly positions parents as spectators rather than the primary architects of their child's learning journey.

2. **Education should adapt to the child, not vice versa** \- We reject the premise that children must conform to standardized approaches and timelines to be successful.

4. **True education prepares children for real life, not just tests** \- We value practical skills, character development, and passion-driven learning over standardized metrics.

5. **Educational freedom is a fundamental right** \- We believe families deserve the resources, support, and freedom to design education that aligns with their values and their children's needs.

### **What We Stand Against (FAD: Against)**

**Common enemies we share with our audience:**

1. **The "sit still and listen" model** \- We oppose forcing active, curious children to suppress their natural energy and learning styles.

4. **The expertise monopoly** \- We oppose systems that disempower parents by positioning them as unqualified to guide their children's education.

3. **We focus on confidence-building over curriculum** \- We believe parental confidence is the foundation of successful alternative education.

4. **We bridge traditional and alternative worlds** \- We don't vilify all aspects of conventional education but help families take the best from all approaches.

5. **We prioritize real family stories over abstract ideals** \- We showcase the messy, imperfect reality of educational freedom rather than presenting an unattainable ideal.
