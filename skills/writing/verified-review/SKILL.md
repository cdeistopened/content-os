### What It Is

Teaching Textbooks is an online math curriculum with video instruction, interactive problems, and automatic grading. Each lesson includes a lecture, practice problems, and a quiz. The program tracks progress, grades everything, and lets students re-watch explanations when they're stuck.

### How We Use It

*— Dalena Wallace, Homeschool Mom of 6 (Kansas)*

With six kids at different math levels, I needed something that would handle instruction and grading without me. Teaching Textbooks does exactly that.

The kids log in, watch the video lesson, and work through the problems. When they get something wrong, they can watch an explanation of how to solve it. I check their progress online, but I'm not sitting next to them teaching or grading papers.

It's not flashy. The videos won't win any awards. But it works. The kids understand the math, they do it independently, and I don't prep lessons or grade anything. For a family trying to outsource wherever possible, that's everything.

### The Verdict

If you need math off your plate, this is it. Affordable, effective, and requires almost zero parent involvement. My kids have used it for years and they're doing well academically - including the two who transferred to private school and had no trouble keeping up.

Not the most exciting curriculum out there, but sometimes you don't need exciting. You need done.

### Best For

- Parents who want to outsource math instruction entirely
- Families with multiple kids at different levels
- Anyone who hates grading
- Students who can work independently
