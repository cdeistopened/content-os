# Email Writing

Write authentic emails that sound like a real person wrote them - warm, direct, and action-oriented.

## Core Principle

**Emails are conversations, not broadcasts.** Write as if speaking to one person, even when sending to many. Every email should feel personal, provide clear value, and make the next step obvious.

## The Email Formula

Every effective email follows this structure:

```
1. CONNECT - Reference something specific to them or the moment
2. VALUE - Share something useful (news, insight, resource)
3. ACTION - Make exactly one clear ask
4. WARMTH - Close with genuine care
```

## Email Types & Templates

### Welcome Email (New Contact)

**Subject:** `Welcome to [Group] + [personal hook]`

```
Dear [Name],

[Thank them + introduce yourself]

[Echo back their interest/message - show you actually read it]

[Good news about their situation - nearby members, relevant resources, etc.]

**Here's how to get connected:**
1. [Immediate action - join Signal/Discord/Slack]
2. [What you'll do - add to list, make introductions]
3. [Optional next step - call, meeting, event]

[Offer phone call for personal connection]

[Blessing/warm close],
[Name]
[Phone number]
[Email]
```

**Key moves:**
- Reference something specific from their signup/message
- Mention geographic neighbors or relevant connections
- Provide exactly 2-3 concrete next steps
- Always offer phone call option
- Include phone number in signature

### Follow-Up Email

**Subject:** `Following up - [specific topic]`

```
Hi [Name],

[Reference last interaction - what you discussed, promised, or asked]

[New information or gentle nudge]

[Restate the ask or provide update]

[Easy out - "No worries if now's not the time"]

[Warm close],
[Name]
```

**Key moves:**
- Be specific about what you're following up on
- Provide new value (resource, connection, update)
- Make it easy to say no - reduces pressure, increases responses
- Keep it short - 3-5 sentences max

### Announcement/Newsletter

**Subject:** `[Group] Update - [Topic] & [Topic]`

```
Dear Friends,

[Opening that connects to season/timing + gratitude]

[News section - 1-2 paragraphs with key updates]
- Links to relevant content
- Welcome new members if applicable

**Upcoming events:**

**[Day, Date - Event Title]**
[2-3 sentences: what, where, why]
[Practical details - what to bring]

**RSVP here:** [Link]

Please drop me a note if you have questions or ideas. I'd love to hear from you by phone!

[Seasonal blessing],
[Name]
[Phone]
```

**Key moves:**
- Use bold for dates/titles - make it scannable
- Include RSVP/calendar links
- Invite questions and phone conversations
- BCC all recipients for privacy

### Outreach/Cold Email

**Subject:** `[Specific reason you're reaching out]`

```
Hi [Name],

[How you found them + genuine compliment on specific work]

[One sentence about what you do]

[Specific ask - simple, concrete]

[What's in it for them - keep brief]

[Warm close],
[Name]
```

**Key moves:**
- Subject line must be specific and intriguing
- First line proves you did your research
- One ask only - don't bundle requests
- Keep under 150 words

## Forbidden Patterns

### AI Tells (from human-writing skill)
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "I wanted to reach out..."
- "I just wanted to..."
- "Per our conversation..."
- "Please don't hesitate to..."
- "Feel free to..."
- "At your earliest convenience"
- "Looking forward to hearing from you"

### Weak Openers
- "I'm emailing because..."
- "This is [Name] from..."
- "I'm reaching out to..."

### Bureaucratic Closings
- "Best regards"
- "Sincerely yours"
- "Respectfully"

## Strong Alternatives

### Openers
- "Thank you for..." (immediate gratitude)
- "Great news:" (positive framing)
- "Quick question:" (direct)
- "[Reference specific thing they did/said]"

### Closings (match the context)
- "God bless," / "In Christ," (faith context)
- "Talk soon," (casual/ongoing relationship)
- "Cheers," (friendly)
- Just your name (clean, confident)

### Instead of "Feel free to..."
- "Happy to hop on a call if useful"
- "Let me know if questions come up"
- "I'm around if you want to chat"

## Charlie's Email Style

For CLM and community-building contexts:

### Signature Moves
1. **Echo their words** - Quote or reference their specific message
2. **Geographic connection** - "Good news: you have neighbors in [City]"
3. **Phone offer** - Always include: "Happy to chat by phone"
4. **Numbered next steps** - 2-3 concrete actions, numbered
5. **Faith grounding** - "God bless" or "In Christ" closings

### Tone Markers
- Warm but not saccharine
- Direct without being curt
- Practical and actionable
- Personally invested

### Always Include
- Phone number in signature
- At least one concrete next step
- Offer of personal connection (call, visit, meeting)
