# Sticky Sentences

Techniques to create memorable statements.

## Alliteration

Same starting sounds:
- "Specificity is the secret"
- "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed"

## Symmetry

Parallel structure:
- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations."

## Contrast

Opposing ideas:
- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere."
- "Be clear, not clever. Concise, not complex."

## Rhyme

Similar ending sounds:
- "Tell a story or lose your glory"

## Rhythm

Pleasing cadence:
- "When you can't wait to share it, they can't help but read it"

## Combinations

For maximum stickiness, combine techniques:
- "Anger prepares us to fight. Fear prepares us to flee." (Symmetry + Alliteration)

## Application

1. Identify 2-3 most important statements in your piece
2. Try each technique on each statement
3. Pick the one that sounds most natural
4. Don't force it - if nothing works, clear prose is better than awkward stickiness
