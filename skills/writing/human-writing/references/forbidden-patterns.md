### Correlative Constructions (THE #1 AI TELL)
- "X aren't just Y - they're Z"
- "It's not about X, it's about Y"

- "No fluff. No theory. Just actionable insights."

### Other Faux-Profound Phrases
- "The truth is..." / "The reality is..."
- "Let that sink in"
- "Now more than ever..."

## Rhetorical Flourishes

- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's be honest..."

## Staccato Phrasing

Do not use faux-dramatic sentence fragments:
- "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
- "Big ideas. Small words. Maximum impact."
- "Simple. Clear. Effective."
- Short. Choppy. Sentences. Like. This.

---

AI groups everything in threes. Avoid:
- "Fast, efficient, reliable"
- "Bold, beautiful, brilliant"
- Any adjective triplet that feels too neat

---

## Openers

- "In the ever-evolving world of..."
- "In today's fast-paced..."
- "Gone are the days when..."
- "In an era where..."
- "Let's dive in..."

## Closers

## Thesaurus Abuse

Don't use fancy words when simple words work:
- "utilize" → just say "use"
- "implement" → just say "start" or "do"
- "optimize" → just say "improve"
- "execute" → just say "do"
- "facilitate" → just say "help"
- "highlighting" → just say "show"

---

## Overused Words

### "Just" and "Actually"
- Bad: "We just need to understand that it's just about learning"
- Good: "It's about learning. Focus on what matters."
- Limit: Once per 500 words maximum for "actually"

### Hedging Stacks
Remove these:
- might / could / perhaps / possibly / maybe
- "may potentially possibly"
- "could perhaps"
- "might be able to"
- "It's worth considering..."
- "You might want to think about..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "Some people say..." → "I've found that..."
- "It could be argued..." → "It's true that..."
- "One could say..." → "This is true because..."

Test: Do I actually believe this? If yes, remove the hedge.

---

## Empty Enthusiasm

- "Absolutely!"
- "Great question!"
- "You're absolutely right!"

---

## Authenticity Theater

- Overusing "real" ("real strategy from real experts getting real results")
- Overusing "actually" to sound casual
- Forced relatability ("we've all been there")

---

## Punctuation Overload

- **Em dash overload**: 6 em dashes per paragraph is a tell
- **Arrow overload**: → used more than once per piece

---

## Passive Voice

- Bad: "It was determined that improvements were needed"
- Good: "We need to improve"

Test: If you can't identify who's doing the action, rewrite it.

---

## Corporate Jargon

- Bad: "Leveraging synergies across stakeholder ecosystems"
- Good: "Getting different people talking to each other"

Test: Would you say this to a friend?

---

## Vague Language

- Bad: "Our users improve"
- Good: "Users improve by 40% in 6 months"

Test: Can you back it up with a specific number, example, or name?

---

## Transitions

Limit transitions to: but, and, so, then, because

Remove: furthermore, moreover, additionally, it's important to note that...

---

## Formatting Rules

- No boldface for emphasis in body text
- No emojis unless explicitly requested
- No summaries like "In conclusion" or "In summary"
- Use hyphens with spaces - like this - not em dashes

---

## The Core Test

> "If I removed the byline and showed this to someone, would they guess AI or human?"

When in doubt: **Does this have fingerprints on it?**
