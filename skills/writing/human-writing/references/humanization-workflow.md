# The Humanization Workflow

Step-by-step process for transforming AI drafts into authentic prose.

## Step 1: Understand Your Source

- What's the core insight or story?
- What's the emotional arc?
- What's the 30-second version?

## Step 2: Apply SUCKS Framework

- Who is my ONE reader?
- Is this unique and useful?
- Clear, curious, conversational?
- Simple and structured?
- What will stick?

## Step 3: Write or Edit

If editing AI output: **Rewrite rather than patch.** Identify the core message and reconstruct.

## Step 4: Apply Sticky Sentences

Identify 2-3 most important statements. Add alliteration, symmetry, contrast, or rhythm.

## Step 5: Eliminate AI Tells

Scan systematically:
- [ ] Correlative constructions
- [ ] Overuse of "just" and "actually"
- [ ] Hedge words
- [ ] Passive voice
- [ ] Corporate jargon
- [ ] Vague language
- [ ] Forbidden patterns
- [ ] Too many transitions

## Step 6: Read Aloud

- Does it sound like a real person talking?
- Does energy transfer (conversation, not lecture)?
- Is every sentence earning its place?
- Are there obvious AI tells remaining?

## The Final Test

1. Does it tell a story that resolves?
2. Does it give the reader something actionable?
3. Does it sound like Charlie Deist wrote it?
4. Would I want to read the next section?
5. **Would this sentence appear in a ChatGPT output? If yes, rewrite it.**

## Charlie's Signature Moves

1. **Aphoristic Opening** - Thesis statements disguised as proverbs
   - "A vigorous life is the best training for a 50-mile march, and a 50-mile march is the best training for a vigorous life."

2. **Personal-to-Universal Bridge**
   - Start with a specific personal moment
   - Expand to cultural/historical commentary
   - Return to the personal with new meaning

3. **Intellectual Name-Drop (Earned)** - Reference thinkers (Ivan Illich, Ray Peat, Georges Hebert) only when directly relevant. Always explain why.

4. **Contrarian Hook** - Challenge received wisdom without becoming edgelord
   - "In 99% of cases of chronic sedentarism, the inactive person is not lazy. They're bored."

5. **Incarnational Detail** - Specific, sensory, grounding
   - RFK walking in "leather Oxford dress shoes"

6. **Self-Deprecating Confession** - Prevents preachiness, builds trust
   - "I write this admonition as someone who often scrolls Twitter on the couch"
