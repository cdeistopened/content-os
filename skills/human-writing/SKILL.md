# Human Writing

Transform AI-assisted drafts into authentic prose. This skill extends `writing-style` with detailed workflows, frameworks, and examples.

**Core Philosophy:** The best writing is invisible. Readers should feel like they're reading a real person's thoughts.

## When to Load This Skill

- Editing AI-generated content for publication
- Writing that must not appear AI-assisted
- Detailed voice work requiring frameworks
- Quality-checking before publish

*For quick checks, `writing-style` (always loaded) has the essentials.*

## The SUCKS Framework

Before writing, answer these:

**S - Specific**: Write for ONE person. If you write for everyone, you write for no one.

**U - Unique & Useful**: Does this change how your reader thinks, feels, or acts?

**C - Clear, Curious, Conversational**: Could a 12-year-old understand the main point? Does it flow like talking to a friend?

**K - Kept Simple**: Simple ideas, simple words, clear structure.

**S - Sticky**: Memorable phrases they'll repeat.

---

## Sticky Sentence Techniques

Create memorable statements using:

**Alliteration** - Same starting sounds
- "Specificity is the secret"
- "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed"

**Symmetry** - Parallel structure
- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations."

**Contrast** - Opposing ideas
- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere."
- "Be clear, not clever."

**Rhythm** - Pleasing cadence through sentence length variation

For maximum stickiness, combine techniques.

---

## Human Markers

Add these to sound like a person wrote it:

**Specificity**: Not "many people" but "twelve developers at a Tuesday standup."

**Opinion**: State your take. "Honestly, most voice matching tools overcomplicate this."

**Limitation**: Admit what you don't know. "This approach fails for highly technical content."

**Rhythm Variation**:
- One-word paragraphs. Really.
- Sentences under 5 words for punch.
- Sentences over 20 words when building an argument that needs room.
- Start with "And" or "But" when natural.
- Parenthetical asides (the kind you'd say to a friend).

---

## Anti-AI Pattern Detection

Beyond the forbidden words/patterns in `writing-style`:

### Overuse of "Just" and "Actually"

AI uses these constantly as softeners. Limit to once per 500 words max.

- ❌ "We just need to understand that it's just about learning"
- ✅ "It's about learning."

### Hedging Language

Eliminate unless genuinely uncertain:

- ❌ "This might help you" → ✅ "This will help you"
- ❌ "It could be argued..." → ✅ State it directly
- ❌ "Perhaps we should consider..." → ✅ "We should..."

### Passive Voice

AI defaults to passive because it's safer.

- ❌ "It was determined that improvements were needed"
- ✅ "We need to improve"

### Corporate Jargon

- ❌ "Leveraging synergies across stakeholder ecosystems"
- ✅ "Getting different people talking to each other"

**Test:** Would you say this to a friend? If not, rewrite.

### Too Many Transitions

AI overuses transitions trying to seem sophisticated.

- ❌ "Furthermore, in addition, moreover..."
- ✅ Strong structure needs fewer transitions. Limit to: but, and, so, then, because.

## The Humanization Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Source

- What's the core insight?
- What's the emotional arc?
- What's the 30-second version?

### Step 2: Apply SUCKS

- Who is my ONE reader?
- Is this unique and useful?
- Can I make it clear and conversational?
- What will stick?

### Step 3: Write or Edit

If editing AI output: Read the entire draft, identify the core message, rewrite rather than patch.

### Step 4: Strengthen Key Statements

Identify 2-3 most important sentences. Apply sticky techniques.

### Step 5: Eliminate AI Tells

Systematic pass for:
- [ ] Correlative constructions
- [ ] "Just" / "Actually" overuse
- [ ] Hedge words
- [ ] Passive voice
- [ ] Corporate jargon
- [ ] Forbidden patterns

### Step 6: Read Aloud

If you stumble reading it, readers will too.

---

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing:

- [ ] No correlative constructions?
- [ ] No forbidden words/openers?
- [ ] Sentence lengths actually vary?
- [ ] At least one specific number or name?
- [ ] Took at least one opinion?
- [ ] Would a smart friend find this interesting?
- [ ] Read aloud without stumbling?

## Before/After Examples

### Correlative Construction

**Before**: "Voice matching isn't just about mimicking words—it's about capturing the rhythm and sensibility behind them."

**After**: "Voice matching captures rhythm and sensibility, not just words."

### AI Opener

**Before**: "In the ever-evolving world of AI-assisted writing, finding your authentic voice has never been more crucial."

**After**: "AI makes everything sound the same. Here's how to make it sound like you."

### Hedge Stack

**Before**: "While there are many approaches to consider, it's important to note that different techniques may work better depending on your specific situation."

**After**: "Start with examples. Everything else is secondary."

### Passive + Jargon

**Before**: "The implementation of our innovative frameworks has demonstrated significant positive outcomes in terms of engagement metrics."

**After**: "Our new approach works. People are paying attention."

## SEO Description Guidelines

For `description` frontmatter field:

- 150-160 characters
- Structure: [What it's about] + [Key insight] + [What you get]
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Still punchy, not generic SEO slop

**Good**: "How I learned to capture any writer's voice—using examples instead of descriptions. A wizard for building reusable voice skills."

**Bad**: "Learn about voice matching techniques. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know."
