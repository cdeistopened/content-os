# Podcast Production - References

Templates, examples, and optional formats for the podcast production workflow.

---

## Core Methodology

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **`checkpoint-1-narrative-snippets.md`** | **PRIMARY** - Story discovery via 6-beat narrative arcs |

This is the recommended approach for Checkpoint 1. Find the story first, then derive all assets from the story's insight and reflection beats.

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `checkpoint-1-template.md` | Legacy template (Big Ideas approach) |
| `checkpoint-2-template.md` | Cold opens and social clips template |
| `checkpoint-3-template.md` | YouTube strategy template (title, thumbnail, chapters) |
| `checkpoint-4-template.md` | Polished transcript and blog post template |

## Examples

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `checkpoint-2-example.md` | Complete Checkpoint 2 example with cold open, clips, and quality gates |

## How to Use

1. **Checkpoint 1**: Use `checkpoint-1-narrative-snippets.md` to find the story arc first
2. **Checkpoint 2**: Use template + example to format cold open and social clips
3. **Checkpoint 3**: Use template to create clean handoff specs for video production
4. **Checkpoint 4**: Use template for final assets; add bonus formats if content fits

## Key Principles Across All Checkpoints

- **Verbatim Only**: All quoted transcript must be exactly as spoken
- **Mine the Entire Transcript**: The strongest angle might be anywhere
- **Bold Over Safe**: Surprising, contrarian moments beat safe observations
- **Story Over Summary**: Create narrative momentum with complete arcs
- **Simple Over Complex**: Thumbnails (3 elements), titles (one idea), clips (clear arc)

## Quality Gates

Each checkpoint has specific quality gates that must pass before moving to the next phase. See individual templates for checkpoint-specific gates.
