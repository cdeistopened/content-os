# Checkpoint 1: Story Discovery via Narrative Snippets

## The Reframe

**Old approach:** List "Big Ideas" → Find clips to illustrate them
**New approach:** Find the STORY → The big idea emerges from the story's insight beat

The story IS the big idea. You don't find ideas then illustrate them - you find stories and the ideas are embedded in them.

## Step 1: Mine the Transcript for Story Arcs

Read the full transcript looking for moments that fit this pattern:

| Beat | What Happens | Signal Phrases |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **1. Setup** | Protagonist in their world, pursuing something | "I was...", "Back when...", "At the time..." |
| **2. Disaster** | Something disrupts the status quo | "Then...", "But...", "Everything changed when..." |
| **3. Failed Approach** | They try the obvious solution, it backfires | "So I tried...", "At first I thought...", "The problem was..." |
| **4. New Insight** | A realization that changes everything | "Then I realized...", "That's when it hit me...", "The breakthrough was..." |
| **5. Resolution** | They apply the insight, it works | "So now...", "Once I started...", "The difference was..." |
| **6. Reflection** | The universal takeaway | "The lesson is...", "What I learned...", "The point is..." |

**Not every story has all 6 beats.** That's fine. Look for at least 4 beats (Setup → Disaster → Insight → Resolution).

## Step 2: Identify 2-3 Story Arcs

For each potential story arc in the transcript, fill in:

### Story Arc A: [Name]

**Protagonist:** [Who is the story about?]

| Beat | Content | Timestamp |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Setup | | |
| Disaster | | |
| Failed Approach | | |
| Insight | | |
| Resolution | | |
| Reflection | | |

**The Big Idea (from Insight/Reflection):**
[What's the universal truth this story reveals?]

**Strength Assessment:**
- [ ] Complete arc (4+ beats present)
- [ ] Emotional stakes clear
- [ ] Insight is non-obvious
- [ ] Reflection has universal application

---

### Story Arc B: [Name]

[Same structure...]

---

### Story Arc C: [Name]

[Same structure...]

---

## Step 3: Select the Primary Story Arc

**Criteria for selection:**

1. **Completeness** - Does it have all 6 beats (or at least 4)?
2. **Emotional resonance** - Do the stakes feel real?
3. **Non-obvious insight** - Does beat 4 surprise?
4. **Universal reflection** - Does beat 6 apply beyond this specific case?
5. **Verbatim strength** - Are the actual words compelling?

**Selected Arc:** [A / B / C]

**Why this arc wins:**
[1-2 sentences explaining the selection]

---

## Step 4: Derive Assets from the Story Arc

Once you have the primary story, everything else flows from it:

### Cold Open
- Include beats 1-3 (Setup → Disaster → Failed Approach)
- TEASE beat 4 (Insight)
- CUT BEFORE beats 5-6

### YouTube Title
- The title promises the INSIGHT (beat 4)
- Or the title promises the REFLECTION (beat 6)

### Thumbnail
- Visual represents the DISASTER (beat 2) or the CONTRAST (before/after)

### Article
- Open with the SETUP (beat 1)
- Walk through the full arc
- End with the REFLECTION (beat 6)

### Social Clips
- Each clip should have its own mini-arc
- Or highlight a single powerful beat

## Derived Assets (Preview)

**Cold Open Direction:**
[Which beats to include, where to cut]

**Title Direction:**
[What the title should promise based on insight/reflection]

**Thumbnail Direction:**
[What visual represents the disaster or contrast]

## CHECKPOINT: User Decision

1. Is the selected story arc the strongest?
2. Are there other story arcs worth considering?
3. Approve to proceed to Checkpoint 2 (Cold Open + Clips)?
```

## Why This Works

The narrative snippets method ensures you're not just pulling "good quotes" - you're finding the **narrative spine** of the episode. Everything else hangs on this spine:

- Cold open teases the spine
- Title promises the insight
- Thumbnail visualizes the tension
- Article walks through the full arc
- Clips are mini-arcs or single powerful beats

This is how the best content creators work. They find the story first.
