This example demonstrates the output format for Checkpoint 2: cold open variations and approved social clips ready for production.

---

## WHAT CHECKPOINT 2 DELIVERS

A single document containing:

1. **Cold Open Script** (one selected variation, verbatim clips only)
2. **On-Screen Text Hooks** (2-4 words each for social media)
3. **3 Approved Social Clips** (full verbatim transcripts with on-screen hooks)
4. **Design Specifications** (text placement, font, timing)

---

## CHECKPOINT 2 OUTPUT FORMAT

### Cold Open Script

**Format:** Verbatim clips arranged in narrative sequence (not chronological)

**Requirements:**

- Duration: 22-35 seconds total
- All quotes must be verbatim (exactly as spoken)
- Arranged for narrative impact (building tension/momentum)
- Ends with unresolved cliffhanger or curiosity loop
- Include speaker labels and approximate timestamps

**Example:**

```
(00:00-00:08)
GUEST: We have convinced ourselves that how we're performing
is a measure of who we are. That we're constantly being judged.
Constantly being compared.

(00:08-00:18)
GUEST: Every year, the same pattern. Every year without exception.
The metrics go down when the pressure stops. The pressure starts again
and it gets worse.

(00:18-00:22)
GUEST: The system itself is the direct cause.

(00:22-00:28)
HOST: So when they asked people what's actually stressing them out...

GUEST: 83% said this one thing. Nothing else came close.
```

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] Passes 4 out of 5 quality tests (Stranger, Itch, Stakes, Tease, Emotion)
- [ ] Ends with unresolved cliffhanger
- [ ] All clips are verbatim
- [ ] Arranged for narrative tension (not chronological order)
- [ ] Duration 22-35 seconds

---

### On-Screen Text Hooks

**Format:** Simple, punchy text designed for YouTube Shorts/TikTok captions

**Requirements:**

- 2-4 words maximum for mobile readability
- Bold, contrarian, or surprising statement
- Complementary to clip content (not redundant)
- Works standalone without audio
- White/light text on semi-transparent dark background

**Example hooks:**

```
Clip 1: "THE SYSTEM IS THE CAUSE"

Clip 2: "YOUR HABIT MIGHT BE HEALTHY"

Clip 3: "WE BLAME THE WRONG THING"
```

**Design Notes:**

- Font: Sans-serif, bold weight
- Placement: Lower 1/3 of frame (doesn't obstruct speaker)
- Duration: On-screen for entire clip
- Testing: Readable at 280px width (mobile phone)

---

### Approved Social Clips

**Format:** 3 distinct clips with complementary angles and on-screen hooks

**Clip Structure:**

- Clip title
- Duration
- On-screen hook (2-4 words)
- Full verbatim transcript
- Platform recommendations
- Best use case (what emotion/action it drives)

**Example Clip:**

### Clip 1: [Descriptive Title]

**Duration:** 1:15 | **On-Screen Hook:** THE SYSTEM IS THE CAUSE

```
GUEST: We have convinced ourselves that how we're performing is a measure
of who we are. That we're constantly being judged. We're constantly being
assessed. We're being compared to others. We're being made to feel like,
if I fail at this, I'm a failure as a human being.

And it's no surprise that every year, this has been true for a long time.
Every year, the metrics plummet when the pressure stops. It goes way down.
The pressure starts up again and it gets worse.

[System] is a direct cause of the problem.
```

**Platform:** YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok

**Best for:** Audience validation / shared frustration

---

### Clip 2: [Descriptive Title]

**Duration:** 1:20 | **On-Screen Hook:** YOUR HABIT MIGHT BE HEALTHY

```
GUEST: Now people had a new way they could do it. And this new approach
is real [activity], people. Adults want to demonize it. But the truth
is this is legitimate. And people enjoy it. It's creative, it's interactive.

And so I went back and reviewed the research, and the research is
unequivocal. Those who were doing this, even controlling for background
factors, were doing better than those who weren't.

So it was kind of a saving grace.
```

**Platform:** YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels

**Best for:** Permission + research credibility

---

### Clip 3: [Descriptive Title]

**Duration:** 1:10 | **On-Screen Hook:** WE BLAME THE WRONG THING

```
GUEST: The story that a lot of people want to believe, which I do not
believe, is that [popular explanation] is the cause. It's very tempting
to look at [behavior] and say, oh, they're addicted to it.

This whole story that has been around for a while is not supported by
science. The scientific research does not support this story. There have
been literally hundreds of studies showing no meaningful correlation.

So we, as a culture, we would far rather blame [easy target] than blame
[actual cause]. [Actual cause] has a halo around it.
```

**Platform:** YouTube, LinkedIn

**Best for:** Contrarian + shareable

---

## CLIP SELECTION GUIDELINES

**Choose 3 clips that:**
- [ ] Have distinct emotional angles (not repetitive)
- [ ] Tell complementary stories (together they build a case)
- [ ] Are 45-90 seconds in duration (complete but concise)
- [ ] Have clear beginning, middle, end (narrative arc)
- [ ] Stand alone compelling (work without episode context)
- [ ] Feature compelling on-screen hooks (2-4 words max)
- [ ] Appeal to target audience
- [ ] Feature direct quotes, not summaries (verbatim only)

---

## QUALITY GATES FOR CHECKPOINT 2

Before moving to Checkpoint 3, verify:

**Cold Open Quality:**

- [ ] Stranger: Opens with surprise/contradiction
- [ ] Itch: Creates curiosity that demands answer
- [ ] Stakes: Makes listener care about the outcome
- [ ] Tease: Ends with unresolved question (doesn't answer it)
- [ ] Emotion: Touches emotional truth (guilt, validation, hope, etc.)

**Cold Open Technical:**

- [ ] Duration: 22-35 seconds
- [ ] All clips verbatim (no paraphrasing)
- [ ] Clear speaker labels and timestamps
- [ ] Arranged for narrative momentum (not chronological)

**Social Clips:**

- [ ] 3 clips with distinct angles
- [ ] Each 45-90 seconds duration
- [ ] Clear on-screen hooks (2-4 words max)
- [ ] All verbatim transcripts
- [ ] Platform recommendations
- [ ] Clear use case for each

**On-Screen Text:**

- [ ] 2-4 words maximum
- [ ] Complementary (not redundant with clip)
- [ ] Readable on mobile (280px width)
- [ ] Engaging/surprising statement

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- Cold open that resolves the tension (always cut before the answer)
- Paraphrased quotes (must be verbatim)
- Clips that don't work standalone (need context from episode)
- On-screen text longer than 4 words (not readable on mobile)
- On-screen text that repeats what the video already shows (redundant)
- All clips making the same point (should have distinct angles)
- Cold open longer than 35 seconds (loses audience)
- Missing platform recommendations (social team needs to know best use)

---

## DELIVERABLE CHECKLIST

When Checkpoint 2 is complete, you should have:

- [ ] One selected cold open script (22-35 seconds, verbatim clips, unresolved ending)
- [ ] 3 approved social clips (45-90 sec each, with on-screen hooks)
- [ ] On-screen text hooks for all 3 clips (2-4 words each)
- [ ] Platform recommendations for each clip
- [ ] Design specifications (font, placement, timing)
- [ ] All quotes are verbatim (no paraphrasing)
- [ ] Quality gates all passed

---

## NEXT PHASE: CHECKPOINT 3

After Checkpoint 2 is approved, move to:

**Checkpoint 3: YouTube Strategy** (title, thumbnail, description, chapters)

Checkpoint 3 takes the approved cold open and clips and develops:

- YouTube title + thumbnail (with guest name)
- YouTube description (hook + full description + resources)
- Chapter breakdown (5-10 words per chapter, keyword-rich)
- All clips organized with final on-screen hooks
