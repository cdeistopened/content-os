## WHAT CHECKPOINT 3 DELIVERS

A two-step document:

**STEP 1 - Title Selection (get approval first):**
1. **10 YouTube Title Options** (using youtube-title-creator frameworks)

**STEP 2 - Assets (after title approval):**
2. **YouTube Thumbnail Spec** (must complement, not repeat, the approved title)
3. **YouTube Description** (opening hook + full description + resources + chapters)
4. **Cold Open Script** (verbatim clips with speaker labels)
5. **Approved Social Clips** (3 clips with on-screen hooks, ready to post)
6. **Chapter Breakdown** (5-10 words per chapter, keyword-rich, compelling)

**Critical workflow**: Do NOT create thumbnail options until title is approved. Thumbnail must complement the title.

## CHECKPOINT 3 OUTPUT FORMAT

### Title Options (10 Required)

Generate 10 title options using the **youtube-title-creator** skill frameworks. Each title should:
- Reference the core topic/tool prominently
- Use a proven framework from the 119 Creator Hooks
- Trigger 2-3 psychological principles (curiosity, desire, negativity, controversy, authority, specificity, etc.)

| # | Title | Framework | Triggers |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | [Title option] | #X - [Framework name] | [Triggers] |
| 2 | [Title option] | #X - [Framework name] | [Triggers] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | [Title option] | #X - [Framework name] | [Triggers] |

**Top 3 Recommendations:** Identify which 3 titles you recommend and why.

**Guidelines:**
- Test against 5-10 frameworks before selecting (avoid first-match bias)
- Apply universalization (remove unnecessary audience filters)
- "Dial to 11" - push to extreme, then pull back one notch
- Pass McDonald's Test (anyone should understand instantly)

---

### Thumbnail Spec (AFTER TITLE APPROVAL)

**Approved Title:** [Insert approved title here]

**Complementarity Rule:** Thumbnail must NOT repeat words from the title. If title says "Claude Code," thumbnail should NOT say "Claude Code."

**Visual:** [Key number or stat] | [Supporting visual element] | [Background color]

**Text:** [2-4 WORDS MAX - must complement, not repeat, title]

**Guidelines:**
- Create AFTER title is approved
- Text: 2-4 words maximum
- Avoid redundancy with title (thumbnail and title should complement, not repeat)
- Make thumbnail readable on mobile (assume 280px width)
- Describe the visual simply (no technical specs)

---

**Structure:**
1. Opening hook sentence (1 sentence max)
2. Full description (2-3 sentences)
3. Resources section (with clickable links)
4. Chapters section (formatted timestamps)
