description: Help a knowledge worker find where their attention earns the fattest margin when combined with AI. Maps their skill stack against AI capabilities to identify high-surplus opportunities vs. commodity traps. Use when someone asks where to focus their AI efforts, how to avoid the allocation economy race-to-zero, or how to build a defensible position as an individual operator.

# Find Your Margin

Audit a knowledge worker's skill stack against AI capabilities to find the narrow lanes where their human judgment + AI throughput creates surplus nobody else can touch. Based on the marginalist insight that intelligence, like capital, flows to the area of highest return — and the counterpoint that individuals win not by competing on allocation efficiency, but by finding fat margins at human scale.

---

## When to Use

- "Where should I actually focus my AI efforts?"
- "I'm using AI for everything but nothing feels defensible"
- "How do I avoid being replaceable by someone with the same tools?"
- "What's my moat in the AI age?"

## The Core Framework

**The Marginal Intelligence Trap:** In a competitive allocation economy, surplus converges toward zero. Everyone uses the same models, the same prompts, the same workflows. The marginal return on one more hour of AI allocation approaches $0.

**The Escape:** Your margin lives where YOUR specific knowledge, taste, and context make AI dramatically more valuable than it would be for anyone else running the same model. Naval: "Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true." Adams: "A combination of mediocre skills can make you surprisingly valuable."

**The Math:** Fat margin = (value of your AI-augmented output) minus (what a generic operator could produce with the same tools). If that gap is small, you're in a commodity trap. If it's large, you've found your margin.

## Workflow

Five steps. Each produces a concrete artifact. Run interactively — present the step, ask questions, wait for answers, synthesize before moving on.

### Step 1: The Skill Stack Audit

Surface everything the user knows, does, or has experienced that might be relevant. Cast wide.

Ask these questions one at a time, wait for full answers:

1. "What do you know deeply — professionally, personally, from hobbies — that most people in your field don't?"
2. "What's the weird combination? The thing that doesn't seem to belong on your resume but actually shapes how you think?"
3. "Where do people come to you specifically — not just anyone with your job title, but YOU?"
4. "What have you learned the hard way that can't be Googled?"

**Output:** A raw list of 8-15 knowledge areas / skills / experiences. Don't filter yet.

### Step 2: The AI Commoditization Map

Take each skill from Step 1 and sort it into one of three buckets:

| Bucket | Definition | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Commoditized** | AI does this as well as you or better. Anyone with a prompt can match your output. | Summarizing articles, basic copywriting, data formatting, code boilerplate |
| **Amplified** | AI makes you 5-10x faster/better, but YOUR input is what makes the output valuable. The AI needs your judgment, taste, or context to produce something good. | Editing with voice, strategic analysis of your specific domain, creative direction |
| **Untouched** | AI can't do this at all. It requires physical presence, relationships, embodied experience, or tacit knowledge that can't be transmitted through text. | Client relationships, physical craft, local/community knowledge, reading a room, taste developed over decades |

For each skill, ask: "If I gave a smart person with no domain experience the same AI tools, could they match your output in this area within a week?" If yes → Commoditized. If they'd need months → Amplified. If they'd need years or could never → Untouched.

**Output:** A three-column map of all skills.

### Step 3: The Margin Finder

The fat margin lives at the INTERSECTION of Amplified and Untouched skills. Specifically:

- Where an **Untouched** skill (your judgment, context, relationships) serves as the INPUT...
- ...that makes an **Amplified** skill dramatically more valuable as the OUTPUT.

Walk through the user's Amplified column and ask for each one:
- "What Untouched skill do you bring to this that makes the AI output actually good?"
- "Who else could provide that same input? How many people?"
- "What would the output look like without your specific input — generic? Wrong? Useless?"

Look for combinations where:
- The input is rare (few people have your specific context)
- The output is valuable (people/companies will pay for it)
- The AI multiplier is large (you couldn't produce this volume/quality alone)

**Output:** 2-4 "margin lanes" — specific combinations of Untouched input + Amplified output where the user has a defensible, high-surplus position.

### Step 4: The Attention Allocation Portfolio

Now design how the user should actually spend their time. Three zones:

**Zone 1 — Delegate Fully (Low Attention, High Autonomy)**
Tasks from the Commoditized column. Set up systems, templates, or workflows where AI runs with minimal supervision. Goal: spend near-zero attention here. Free up hours.

Ask: "What are you still doing manually that AI already does well enough? What would you delegate to a competent intern and never check?"

**Zone 2 — Verify Lightly (Medium Attention, Medium Autonomy)**
Tasks from the Amplified column that DON'T intersect with your core margin lanes. AI does the heavy lifting; you do a quality pass. Good enough is good enough.

Ask: "Where are you over-polishing AI output that's already 80% there? Where is your perfectionism costing you time without earning you margin?"

**Zone 3 — Full Presence (High Attention, Low Autonomy)**
Your margin lanes from Step 3. This is where your attention earns the most. AI handles throughput; you provide the judgment, taste, context, and creativity that makes the output irreplaceable.

Ask: "If you could only spend 2 hours a day on AI-augmented work, which tasks would earn you the most — in money, reputation, or satisfaction?"

**Output:** A three-zone portfolio with specific tasks in each zone and estimated time allocation.

### Step 5: The Margin Map

Synthesize everything into a one-page document:

```
FIND YOUR MARGIN — RESULTS
===========================

Name: [User]
Date: [Today]

YOUR SKILL STACK
  Core skills: [2-3 from Untouched column]
  AI-amplified skills: [2-3 from Amplified column]
  Commoditized (delegate these): [list]

YOUR MARGIN LANES
  Lane 1: [Untouched input] + [Amplified output] = [specific value created]
  Lane 2: [Untouched input] + [Amplified output] = [specific value created]

YOUR ATTENTION PORTFOLIO
  Delegate Fully (~X hrs/wk): [tasks]
  Verify Lightly (~X hrs/wk): [tasks]
  Full Presence (~X hrs/wk): [tasks — your margin lanes]

THE FAT MARGIN TEST
  "If a smart generalist with the same AI tools tried to compete
   with me in [Lane 1/2], they would fail because: _______________"

NAVAL CHECK
  "I am becoming the best in the world at [redefine what you do
   based on your margin lanes, not your job title]."

FIRST MOVE
  This week, shift [specific task] from Zone 3 to Zone 1 or 2,
  and reinvest that time into [specific margin lane activity].
```

**Output:** The completed Margin Map.

## Facilitation Notes

- **The "weird thing" is usually the margin.** The skill or experience that feels irrelevant is often what makes the combination rare. Push for it in Step 1.
- **Most people overestimate what's commoditized.** They assume AI can do everything. Challenge this — AI with YOUR context is different from AI with no context. The context IS the value.
- **Most people underestimate what's untouched.** Relationships, taste, local knowledge, physical presence — these feel "soft" but they're the hardest to replicate and the most valuable as inputs.
- **The portfolio is not permanent.** As models improve, skills migrate from Amplified to Commoditized. The margin lanes shift. Revisit quarterly.
- **Fat margins > thin margins.** A small operation earning large surplus per unit of attention beats a large operation earning thin surplus. The goal is not maximum throughput — it's maximum surplus per hour of YOUR attention.
