## OpenEd Editorial Version

```
Create a conceptual editorial illustration of a paper airplane in flight.

CONCEPT: A single paper airplane mid-flight, trailing a dotted line path behind it. The trajectory curves gently, suggesting journey and direction. Simple, confident, iconic.

STYLE: Hand-drawn editorial illustration with confident ink linework. Intentional imperfection - not polished or corporate. Subtle watercolor wash for depth.

COMPOSITION: Paper airplane in the upper portion of frame, dotted line trailing from lower left toward it. Generous negative space. Asymmetrical balance.

COLORS: Near-black linework. Warm cream background. Burnt orange wash on the paper airplane. Sky blue dotted line for the trajectory.

TEXTURE: Visible ink strokes, hand-drawn feel. Paper grain subtle but present.

AVOID: Text, gradients, glossy rendering, additional objects, busy backgrounds, realistic paper texture.

FORMAT: 16:9 landscape

## Minimalist Ink Version

```
Create a minimalist ink illustration of a paper airplane in flight.

CONCEPT: A paper airplane with a dotted line trajectory trailing behind it. The path curves upward. Clean, iconic, immediate.

STYLE: High-contrast black and white ink illustration. Hand-drawn quality with confident linework. Use crosshatching sparingly - maybe just to give the airplane some dimension. Think literary magazine or New Yorker editorial art.

COMPOSITION: Airplane positioned in upper right, trajectory line sweeping in from lower left. Generous white space. The dotted line should feel hand-drawn, not mechanical.

RENDERING: Pure black ink on white. Linework should feel human - slight variation in stroke weight. Dots in the trajectory line slightly irregular.

AVOID: Gray tones, gradients, color of any kind, photorealistic rendering, digital-looking lines, busy backgrounds.

FORMAT: 16:9 landscape

## Watercolor + Line Version

```
Create a watercolor and ink illustration of a paper airplane in flight.

CONCEPT: A paper airplane trailing a dotted line path behind it. The trajectory curves gracefully. Warm, optimistic, hand-crafted.

STYLE: Hand-drawn ink linework with loose watercolor washes. Confident, slightly sketchy lines provide structure. Watercolor bleeds naturally beyond the lines.

COMPOSITION: Paper airplane in upper portion, dotted trajectory sweeping up from lower left. Plenty of breathing room. Off-center, natural balance.

COLORS: Limited palette - burnt orange wash on the airplane, sky blue for the dotted trajectory line. Near-black ink linework. Warm off-white paper showing through generously.

TEXTURE: Visible brushstrokes in watercolor areas. Paper grain showing. Natural watercolor pooling on the airplane shape.

AVOID: Digitally perfect edges, too many colors, busy composition, text, overly saturated tones.

FORMAT: 16:9 landscape
