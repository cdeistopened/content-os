# Ed the Horse - Error/Frustration

OpenEd's mascot Ed (a horse with glasses) having tech difficulties. Good for: error pages, loading states, "something went wrong" messages, tech support content.

---

## Standard Version

```
Create an illustration of a cartoon horse wearing round glasses, looking frustrated at a laptop computer.

CONCEPT: A friendly horse character (named Ed) wearing round spectacles, sitting or standing at a laptop. Small frustration marks (like manga-style anger symbols or sweat drops) near his head. He's having a "tech difficulties" moment.

STYLE: Hand-drawn ink illustration with subtle watercolor wash. Friendly and approachable but not childish. Think editorial cartoon character - expressive, slightly exaggerated features. The horse should have personality.

COMPOSITION: Ed and the laptop as the clear focal point. Simple or no background. The frustration marks floating near his head. Medium shot - we see his upper body/head and the laptop clearly.

COLORS: Near-black linework. Warm cream background. Burnt orange on the glasses frames and frustration marks. Sky blue as a subtle accent on the laptop screen glow or a small element.

EXPRESSION: Furrowed brow, maybe one eye squinting. Clearly annoyed but in a relatable, comedic way - not angry. The "why isn't this working" face.

TEXTURE: Hand-drawn quality, visible ink strokes. Not too polished.

AVOID: Realistic horse anatomy, photorealistic rendering, scary or aggressive expression, busy backgrounds, text on screen.

FORMAT: 1:1 square

## Variations to Try

**Confused Ed** (for "page not found"):
- Change expression to puzzled rather than frustrated
- Maybe scratching head with hoof
- Question marks instead of frustration marks

**Apologetic Ed** (for "we're sorry"):
- Sheepish expression, slight smile
- Maybe a small shrug gesture
- Sweat drop rather than anger marks

**Working on it Ed** (for "loading" or "please wait"):
- Determined expression, focused
- Typing actively on keyboard
- No frustration marks - just concentration
