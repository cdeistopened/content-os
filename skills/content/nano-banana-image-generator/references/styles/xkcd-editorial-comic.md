# XKCD-Inspired Editorial Comic Style

Generate comics in the spirit of XKCD - minimalist line art with dry, clever humor - without being a direct ripoff.

## Visual Style

- **Line art:** Simple black ink on pure white background
- **Characters:** Rounded simple figures (not pure stick figures, but close) - large circular heads, simple dot eyes, minimal features
- **Line quality:** Hand-drawn wobbly quality, variable weight, not perfectly straight
- **Color:** None. Black and white only.
- **Detail level:** Minimal. Only elements necessary for the joke. No shading, no hatching, no fills.
- **Format:** Horizontal landscape (16:9) for social, square (1:1) for Instagram

## What Makes It XKCD (Not Far Side, Not New Yorker)

| XKCD | Far Side / Existing Comic Skill |
|------|------|
| Multi-panel or diagrammatic | Single panel |
| Charts, flowcharts, graphs as humor vehicles | Scene-based |
| Dialogue in speech bubbles or labels | Caption below image |
| Nerdy/data-driven punchlines | Absurdist/dark humor |
| Minimal characters, maximum information | Character-driven |
| Dry, deadpan delivery | Setup-and-punch rhythm |

## Humor Patterns That Work

1. **The Flowchart** - Decision tree where every path leads to the same absurd conclusion. Comedy from the inevitability.
2. **The Graph** - Real data presented visually with one devastating observation. Let the numbers be the joke.
3. **The Side-by-Side** - Two scenes that should be similar but aren't. The contrast IS the punchline (e.g., career fair booths).
4. **The Label** - Ordinary scene made absurd by what the signs/labels say.
5. **The Scale** - Show the absurd difference in scale between two things (e.g., $234 vs $100,000 as physical objects).

## Prompt Template

```
XKCD-inspired editorial comic, simple minimal line art on pure white background.
[SCENE DESCRIPTION with specific text for all labels, signs, speech bubbles].
Simple black ink lines on white, hand-drawn wobbly quality, no color fills,
minimal detail, deadpan humor. Horizontal landscape format.
```

## Key Prompt Tips

- Spell out ALL text you want in the image - Gemini will try to render it
- Describe character emotions through simple visual cues (question marks, sweat drops, sunglasses for cool)
- Use props that communicate instantly (cobwebs = neglected, coffee = relaxed, briefcases = recruiters)
- Keep the text short - fewer words = better rendering accuracy
- If text comes out garbled, simplify to fewer words per element

## Proven Concepts (Feb 2026)

### College Flowchart
"SHOULD I GO TO COLLEGE?" decision tree. Paths: "What job?" → "Not sure" → "So you want to borrow $100K for...?" with options (experience, parents expect it, everyone else, find myself) all looping to absurd responses, converging on "Take out $100,000 loan anyway - MOST POPULAR PATH."

### Career Fair
Two booths side by side. Left: "COMPUTER SCIENCE - 7.5% UNEMPLOYMENT" with empty booth, cobwebs, wilting plant, confused person. Right: "ART HISTORY - 3.0% UNEMPLOYMENT" with recruiters lined up, person leaning back with sunglasses and coffee. "CLASS OF 2026" sign between them.

## OpenEd Application

Best for:
- Newsletter header images (data-driven humor)
- X/Twitter posts (high shareability, conversation starters)
- Instagram carousels (each panel = one slide)
- LinkedIn posts (professional enough, clever enough)

Pair with: Infographic data from newsletters, Rob Henderson-style data commentary, Isaac Morehouse contrarian takes.

Avoid:
- Don't use for formal brand content (website headers, ads)
- Don't copy XKCD's exact stick figure proportions - keep it inspired, not imitative
- Don't overload with text - if it needs more than 30 words total, simplify
