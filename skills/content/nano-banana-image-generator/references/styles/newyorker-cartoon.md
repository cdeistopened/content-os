## Visual Style

**Line Work:**
- Simple pen-and-ink illustration - like it was sketched with a single pen
- Clean, confident lines - NOT heavily detailed or overly rendered
- Minimal to NO crosshatching - when used, very sparse and suggestive
- Organic, slightly loose linework - not rigid or digital
- NO vignette fade - clean edges that stop naturally

**CRITICAL - Keep It Simple:**
- The magic of New Yorker cartoons is restraint
- Think quick sketch, not detailed illustration
- Characters should be simple, almost schematic
- Backgrounds minimal or suggested with just a few lines
- The fewer lines, the better - every line must earn its place

**Format:**
- 1:1 square aspect ratio (ideal for social)
- Single panel only
- Plain white background - NO texture, NO cream, NO paper grain
- Pure black ink on clean white - high contrast

**Caption:**
- Italic serif font (Garamond, Times, or similar)
- Centered below illustration
- One sentence only
- Period at end (not exclamation)

## What Makes It Distinctly New Yorker

The New Yorker cartoon is NOT:
- Detailed illustration with lots of crosshatching
- Heavily rendered or shaded
- Cartoonish in a Pixar/animation way
- Textured or atmospheric

The New Yorker cartoon IS:
- Quick, confident pen strokes
- Almost like a napkin sketch elevated to art
- Sparse - 80% white space
- Characters that are simple but expressive
- Environments suggested with minimal lines

**Reference artists:** Roz Chast, Bruce Eric Kaplan, Liana Finck, Edward Koren

## Humor Elements

The New Yorker cartoon voice is:

1. **Understated** - The joke lands softly, not with a punchline
2. **Observational** - Notices absurdity in everyday life
3. **Detached irony** - Characters seem unaware of the absurdity
4. **Unexpected framing** - The caption does work the image doesn't

**What makes it funny:**
- Contrast between mundane setting and absurd detail
- Characters taking ridiculous things seriously
- Modern anxieties rendered in domestic scenes
- The reader feeling "seen" rather than laughing out loud

## Caption Formulas
