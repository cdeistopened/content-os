# Editorial Infographic (Vox-Inspired)

Bold, textured data visualization with editorial personality. Inspired by Vox explainers, risograph prints, and screen-printed posters. Information-dense but visually warm — not clinical, not corporate.

## When to Use

- Schedule/timeline visualizations ("Day in the Life")
- Comparison charts and spectrum diagrams
- Statistical breakdowns and data stories
- Any infographic that needs to feel hand-made, not PowerPoint

## Visual Approach

The key tension: **structured data + organic texture.** The information is clear and hierarchical, but the surface feels printed, not digital. Like a well-designed zine or an indie magazine data page.

**Key characteristics:**
- Bold, slightly imperfect color blocks (not gradient-smooth)
- Visible print texture — halftone dots, ink grain, paper fiber
- Hand-lettered or bold sans-serif typography (not thin/elegant)
- Organic shapes containing data (not perfect geometric containers)
- Layered depth — elements feel stacked/overlapping, not flat
- Subtle misregistration (colors don't line up perfectly, like screen printing)
- Warm background — kraft paper, cream, or off-white with visible grain

**The feel:** A poster you'd buy at a design bookshop. Something between a Vox explainer frame and a risograph art print.

## Color Application

For OpenEd brand consistency:
- **Deep navy or charcoal** (#1a1a2e or #2d2d2d) for primary text and containers
- **Burnt orange** (#d4622b) bold blocks for emphasis and key data
- **Sky blue** (#4a90d9) for secondary data segments
- **Cream/warm white** (#f5f0e8) textured background
- **Warm gray** (#8a8580) for supporting elements
- **Optional accent:** Mustard yellow (#d4a72c) sparingly for highlights

Palette should feel like a 3-color screen print — limited, intentional, bold.

## Typography Direction

- **Headlines/titles:** Heavy weight, all-caps or bold mixed case. Large. Confident.
- **Data labels:** Medium weight sans-serif. Clear but not precious.
- **Small text/annotations:** Light italic or handwritten feel.
- Hierarchy does the work — size contrast between levels should be dramatic.

## Texture & Surface

This is what separates editorial infographics from generic ones:
- **Paper grain:** Visible fiber texture in the background, like kraft or newsprint
- **Ink texture:** Colors should look printed, not digitally filled — slight variation in density
- **Halftone/dot patterns:** Subtle dot screens in lighter color areas
- **Edge quality:** Not razor-sharp — slightly soft or rough edges on color blocks
- **Overlay effects:** Where colors overlap, they mix like transparent inks

## Technical Direction

```
STYLE: Bold editorial infographic with risograph/screen-print texture. Think Vox explainer meets indie design poster. Information is clear and hierarchical, but the surface has warmth and grain — visible paper texture, ink variation, subtle halftone patterns. NOT flat digital. NOT corporate.

RENDERING: Bold color blocks with visible print texture. Colors feel like thick ink on textured paper — not digitally perfect. Slight misregistration where colors meet. Typography is confident and heavy, not thin or elegant.

TEXTURE: Kraft paper or cream background with visible grain. Halftone dot patterns in lighter areas. Ink density varies slightly across color blocks. Edges are slightly soft, like screen printing. Where colors overlap, they blend like transparent inks.

TYPOGRAPHY: Bold sans-serif for titles (heavy weight, large). Clear labels for data. Strong size hierarchy — title should dominate. Text rendered as integral part of the design, not floating on top.

## Example Prompt Structure

```
Create a bold editorial infographic showing [SUBJECT/DATA].

CONCEPT: [What data are we visualizing? What's the key insight?]

STYLE: Risograph/screen-print aesthetic with Vox-style information hierarchy. Bold color blocks on textured cream/kraft paper. Visible halftone dots, ink grain, and slight print misregistration. Think indie design poster, not corporate chart.

COMPOSITION: [Clock face / timeline / comparison / spectrum — describe layout]

DATA: [List the specific data points, segments, labels]

TYPOGRAPHY: Bold heavy sans-serif title at top. Clear labels on each segment. Strong size hierarchy — title dominates, labels support.

COLORS: Limited 3-color palette — deep navy, burnt orange, and sky blue on warm cream background. Colors feel like thick screen-print ink with visible texture.

TEXTURE: Paper grain throughout. Halftone dot patterns in lighter areas. Slightly rough edges on color blocks. Ink variation across fills — not perfectly uniform.

AVOID: Flat digital fills, perfect geometric shapes, corporate chart styling, thin/elegant typography, pure white background, gradient effects, 3D effects, clip art icons.

FORMAT: 1:1 square

## Good Subjects for This Style

- Daily schedules / "Day in the Life" clock diagrams
- Before/after comparisons
- Statistical breakdowns (time allocation, budget, demographics)
- Spectrum/scale visualizations
- Process flows and timelines
- Any data that tells a story
