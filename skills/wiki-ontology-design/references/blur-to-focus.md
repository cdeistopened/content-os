# Blur to Focus

A wiki ontology should tighten in stages:

1. **Blur**: a noisy cloud of recurring terms.
2. **Outline**: 3-7 broad domains.
3. **Structure**: subtopics and clear boundaries.
4. **Precision**: frameworks, cases, people, episodes.

Approval gates:
- Approve domain list before subtopics.
- Approve final map before scaffolding.
