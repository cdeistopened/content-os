# Instagram Captions - Platform Heuristics

**Note:** This is for TEXT captions on Instagram posts, carousels, and Reels. For video creation and on-screen text, use `short-form-video` skill.

## Success Heuristic

**Visual-first, caption supports** - Instagram is a visual platform. The caption's job is to add context, drive engagement, or tell a micro-story that complements the visual.

Audience is further up the funnel - problem aware but not solution aware. Discovery phase.

## Quick Specs

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Optimal length** | 30-125 characters for feed |
| **Longer captions** | Work with strong hook |
| **Hashtags** | 5-10 relevant tags |
| **Voice** | Friendly, authentic, micro-story |

---

## Caption Types by Format

### Reel Captions
- Hook that complements video hook
- 1-2 sentences max
- CTA or question at end
- Hashtags below main caption

### Carousel Captions
- Summarize value proposition
- "Swipe for..." hook
- Single insight that ties slides together
- Can be longer (100-200 chars)

### Static Image Captions
- Micro-story format
- One-liner works well
- Personal reflection
- Question to drive comments

---

## What Works

### Formats
- One-liners (punchy, shareable)
- Micro-stories (3-5 sentences, personal)
- Question hooks (drive comments)
- "Save this for later" prompts
- CTA-driven (follow, share, tag)

### Hook Patterns
- Start with the punchline
- Open with curiosity gap
- Direct address ("You know that feeling when...")
- Contrarian statement

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Text walls without line breaks
- Hashtags in caption body (put at end or in comments)
- Corporate voice
- Over-explaining the visual
- Arrow bullets - AI tell

---

## Voice

- Friendly, authentic
- Micro-story format
- Less formal than LinkedIn, warmer than X
- Personal but not oversharing
- Visual storytelling support

---

## Hashtag Strategy

**Count:** 5-10 relevant tags

**Placement options:**
1. After caption with line break
2. In first comment (cleaner look)

**Mix:**
- 2-3 broad (e.g., #homeschool, #education)
- 3-5 niche (e.g., #microschoollife, #unschooling)
- 1-2 branded if applicable

---

## OpenEd-Specific Notes

- **Audience:** Earlier in journey, discovery phase
- **Goal:** Awareness, not conversion
- **Content:** Problem-aware content that validates struggle

## Template Recommendations

From `references/templates/`:
- **One-liners** - All patterns work, especially Aspirational, Values, Observations
- **Post structures** - Heavy Hitting One-Liner, Making Reader Feel Good

From `references/linkedin/`:
- **Story** - Micro versions of transformation, values (shorten dramatically)

*Note: For Reel/video creation, use `short-form-video` skill.*
