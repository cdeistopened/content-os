# X/Twitter - Platform Heuristics

## Success Heuristic

**"I wish I said that"** - Content people want to affiliate with. Retweet-worthy means the person is saying "this represents me" or "I wish I had thought of that."

On X, you're crafting quotable statements people want to claim as their own.

## Quick Specs

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Optimal length** | 70-100 chars (despite 280 limit) |
| **Hashtags** | 0-2 max (often 0 is best) |
| **Links** | OK but can reduce reach |
| **Voice** | Witty, concise, confident |

## What Works

### Content Types
- Short, punchy takes (70-100 chars optimal)
- Threads for longer concepts (each tweet should stand alone)
- Quote tweets adding value to trending content
- Replies that add insight (reply game > posting until 500-1000 followers)

### Formats
- One-liners that crystallize a truth
- Pattern recognition ("I've noticed...")
- Contrarian takes ("Unpopular opinion...")
- Lists with surprising entries
- Before/after framings

### Thread Best Practices
- Hook in first tweet
- 3-7 tweets ideal length
- One idea per tweet (each should stand alone)
- Visual pattern (bullets, numbers, breaks)
- CTA or question in final tweet

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Threads where tweets don't stand alone
- Too formal/corporate voice
- Hashtag overload
- Long-winded explanations
- Arrow bullets (→) - AI tell
- "Here's the thing:" throat-clearing
- Hedging ("maybe we should consider...")

---

## Voice

- Witty, concise, confident
- Slightly irreverent
- Strong opinions stated simply
- No hedging or qualifications
- Like texting a smart friend

## Growth Strategy

**Under 1000 followers:**
- Reply game > posting
- Create two lists: Peers + Big accounts
- Reply 20 times while curating content
- Comment on trending tweets
- Quote-tweet with added perspective

**Over 1000 followers:**
- Shift to original content
- Build threads from your best tweets
- Tag people who will RT

## Guest Tagging Checklist

**Before posting podcast/interview content:**

1. Identify guest(s) featured in the source content
2. Search for their X handle (web search: "[Name] [Company] Twitter X account")
3. Verify it's the correct person (check bio, recent posts)
4. Tag them in the post - increases reach, they may RT
5. If company has separate account, consider tagging both

**Why this matters:** Tagged guests often retweet, expanding reach to their audience. A guest RT can 10x a post's impressions.

## Template Recommendations

From `references/templates/`:
- **One-liners** - Most native to X format
- **Post structures** - Behavior Dichotomy, Contrarian Post, Heavy Hitting One-Liner

From `references/linkedin/`:
- **Contrarian** - Hot takes translate well to X (shorten)

## Posting Workflow

For the full posting and scheduling workflow (getlate.dev API, scheduling files, batch processing), use the `x-posting` skill.

*Note: Video on X uses `short-form-video` skill instead.*
