# Day-in-the-Life Blog Post Skill

Write Day-in-the-Life homeschool blog posts that show how specific families structure their learning, with enough detail that readers can visualize themselves doing it.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating a Day-in-the-Life post from a podcast transcript or interview
- Writing about a specific family's homeschool approach
- Building content that showcases real-world hybrid/homeschool schedules
- Creating relatable "here's how we actually do it" content

## Inputs Required

1. **Source Material**: Podcast transcript, interview notes, or detailed conversation
2. **Family Context**: Number of kids, years homeschooling, educational philosophy
3. **Key Details**: Schedule, curriculum mentions, co-ops, tutors, pivots they've made

## Output Format

The Day-in-the-Life post has two main sections:

### Part 1: The Narrative (~800-1,200 words)

**1. Opening Hook + Philosophy Statement**
- Start with something counterintuitive or specific about their approach
- State the educational philosophy in 1-2 sentences
- Example: "I'm not a morning person. I'm not a natural teacher. After 13 years of homeschooling - including nearly quitting from burnout - I've stopped pretending otherwise."

**2. The "Controversial" Choice Section**
- Address the thing that would raise eyebrows in traditional schooling
- Explain why they chose it and what they were escaping
- Frame it as intentional, not lazy
- Examples: Late starts, no grades, screen time, unschooling elements

**3. How It Started**
- The backstory of how they arrived at their current approach
- Usually involves a struggle or pivot point
- Shows evolution over time

**4. The Weekly Rhythm**
- Specific days and what happens on each
- Include times where relevant
- Show who teaches what and when

**5. What I've Learned to Let Go**
- Things they used to do that weren't sustainable
- Permission-giving for readers struggling with similar things

**6. The Secret: Know Your Limits**
- The insight that made everything work
- Usually involves honest self-assessment

**7. When Kids Need Something Different**
- How they handle pivots and changes
- Examples of trying things and stopping when they don't work
- Frame: "Trial and error is the method, not the mistake"

**8. Building the Network (if applicable)**
- Community connections, co-ops, micro school networks
- How they found or built their "village"

### Part 2: The Inventory (~300-500 words)

Organized by category, each item includes:
- Name (linked)
- Brief description
- How this family specifically uses it
- Note on OpenEd reimbursability where relevant

**Categories to include:**
- Math
- History
- Language Arts
- The Village (tutors, co-ops, hired teachers)
- Networks (organizations, groups)

## Tone & Voice

- First person, conversational
- Specific details (times, names, anecdotes)
- Honest about struggles (not aspirational Instagram homeschool)
- Permission-giving (validates unconventional choices)
- Practical (readers should be able to copy elements)

## Style Approach

**The intro can be crafted.** This is where visible prose craft shows—sentence variety, strategic fragments, a memorable opening. Think Nora Ephron's *techniques* (rhythm, punch, specificity) without imposing her voice.

**The body relaxes.** After the intro, let the guest's natural speech patterns take over. Longer sentences are fine. Verbal connectors ("And so...", "kind of just...") can stay. The structure is organized but the voice sounds like them talking.

**Sticky phrases throughout.** Pull from the Guest Voice Inventory (Checkpoint 1). Every 200-300 words, include at least one characteristic phrase they actually said. These are what make them think "that's definitely me."

**The goal:** The guest should feel like they said exactly this—just better organized, like they had time to think.

## Formatting Elements

Use liberally for scannability:
- **Bold section headers** within the narrative
- **Bullet lists** for schedules and inventories  
- **Tables** for weekly rhythms (day | activity)
- **Horizontal rules** between major sections
- **Short paragraphs** (2-4 sentences in body sections)

## What Makes It Work

1. **Specificity**: Real names of curricula, real times, real anecdotes
2. **Permission**: Validates choices that might feel "wrong" in traditional schooling
3. **Practicality**: Readers can implement pieces immediately
4. **Personality**: The family's unique voice and values come through
5. **Inventory**: Concrete takeaways they can shop/research

## Hyperlinking

**Hyperlink proper nouns on first mention in the body text**, not just in the inventory:
- Curricula (Prodigy, Life of Fred, etc.)
- Tools and apps
- Organizations and co-ops (if they have websites)
- Guest's social media / website

This lets readers click through immediately when something catches their interest, rather than having to scroll to the inventory.

## Quote Integration

- Pull direct quotes from transcripts but integrate naturally
- Do NOT have the subject quote themselves ("As I tell people...")
- Polish quotes so they flow as first-person narrative
- Preserve the authentic voice and specific details
- Use the Guest Voice Inventory from Checkpoint 1 to identify sticky phrases to weave throughout

## Podcast Link

At the end of the article, include a hyperlinked call to listen to the full episode:

```markdown
---

*Listen to the full conversation with [Guest] on the [OpenEd Podcast](URL).*
```

Link to the actual podcast episode (YouTube, Spotify, or podcast page as appropriate).

## Example Opening Lines

Good:
- "6 kids. 4 homeschooled. 2 in private school. 0 days that look the same."
- "Our school day doesn't start until 10:00 AM. We spend weeks studying 'Pet Adoption' or 'Bigfoot.' This isn't a compromise."
- "I called them my 'Weepy Wednesdays' - by midweek, I was done."

Avoid:
- "Welcome to a day in the life of our homeschool family!"
- "Let me share how we do things..."
- Generic descriptions without specific details

## Length

- Main narrative: 800-1,200 words
- Inventory: 300-500 words
- Total: ~1,200-1,700 words
