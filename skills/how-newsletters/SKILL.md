## Usage Pattern

1. **Before writing**: Read 1-2 relevant case studies from the library to internalize the voice
2. **During writing**: Reference specific techniques from the case studies
3. **After writing**: Compare draft against case study examples for authenticity

## Style Principles (Extracted Themes)

From analyzing these newsletters, common principles emerge:

1. **Voice over information** - The personality matters as much as the content
2. **Specificity creates trust** - Concrete details > vague claims
3. **Opinions are features** - Strong takes differentiate from AI-generated content
4. **Rhythm matters** - Sentence length variation creates readability
5. **Cultural references anchor** - References to real things signal human authorship
6. **Imperfection is authentic** - Contractions, incomplete sentences, parentheticals

## Example Invocation

When user asks: "Help me write a newsletter intro about productivity tools"

1. Read relevant case study (e.g., "What we can learn from James Clear")
2. Note the specific techniques used
3. Apply those techniques to the user's topic
4. Write in that voice, not generic AI prose
