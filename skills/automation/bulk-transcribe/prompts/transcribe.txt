## PRIORITY REASONING TASKS (spend thinking time here)

### 1. Speaker Identification
Listen carefully for:
- How speakers address each other by name
- Voice characteristics (pitch, pace, energy level)
- Introduction of guests ("Welcome back, [Name]" / "Today we have [Name]")
- Self-references that reveal identity

{host_hints}

For guests: Identify from introductions. If unclear, use **Guest:** until name is revealed.

### 2. Topic Segmentation for Chunking
Add `## Section Header [MM:SS]` at NATURAL BREAK POINTS:
- New topic introduction ("Let's talk about..." / "Next category...")
- Guest introductions
- Major subject changes
- After sponsor breaks (which you'll remove)

Aim for 8-15 sections per hour. Each section = one semantic chunk for RAG retrieval.

## Output Format

1. One paragraph summary (2-3 sentences)
2. **Topics:** comma-separated tags
3. **Speakers:** list all identified speakers
4. Full transcript with:
   - `## Section Title [MM:SS]` headers at topic breaks
   - `**Name:**` speaker labels
   - Clean paragraphs

## Rules

- Transcribe EVERYTHING verbatim - do NOT summarize content
- REMOVE sponsor/ad reads entirely (don't wrap, just omit)
- Fix obvious speech-to-text errors
- Preserve speaker's natural voice and word choices
