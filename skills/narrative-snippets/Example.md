Template 1: Most People Just Go Away (Schultz)
In the Spring of 1982, Howard Schultz flew to San Francisco for a dinner meeting with the founders of Starbucks, hoping to finally secure a job offer at the fledgling coffee company. Schultz had spent the past year flying back and forth between coasts to nurture the relationship, arriving each time with "a long list of ideas" for how Starbucks could be improved.
"The dinner went exceptionally well," Schultz recalls. "I nodded and congratulated myself as I walked back to the hotel." "I was convinced that after all my lobbying I had the job all but sown up. I figured I would fly back to New York with an offer in hand."
The next day, the call came. "I'm sorry Howard, I have bad news." Schultz remembers the voice over the phone saying. It was Jerry, one of the founders. "I couldn't believe the somber tone of his voice or the words. The three of them had talked it over and decided not to hire me. 'But… why?' 'It's too risky, too much change.'" "Your plans sound great but that's just not the vision we have for Starbucks."
The distant click of the receiver dropping told Schultz the call was over—and so was his dream: "I saw my whole future flash in front of me and then crash and burn."
"Most people," Schultz acknowledges, "when turned down for a job—just go away." But "this was, I thought, a turning point in my life. It had to happen. I had to join Starbucks."
So instead of going away, Schultz called Jerry back the next day. "'Jerry, you're making a terrible mistake,' I said, 'after all this time we owe it to ourselves to isolate the issues, what exactly is the reason?' Very calmly, we talked it over. The concern was this: the partners did not want to give me license to change the company. They worried that by hiring me, they would be committing themselves to a new direction for Starbucks."
"Jerry," Schultz urged, "'this isn't about me, it's about you. The destiny of Starbucks is at stake. We've talked so much about what Starbucks can be. It's your company, it's your vision, you're the only one who can achieve it, somebody has to be courageous here and it's you! Don't let them talk you out of something that you believe in your heart.'"
When the phone rang again the next morning, Schultz "picked up the phone on the first ring."
"I'm sorry about the twenty four hour impasse," Jerry said. "We're going forward, you have the job, Howard, and you have my commitment. When can you come?"
Five years after this moment, Schultz would end up buying the company outright, and begin the journey of growing Starbucks from the six stores it had at the time to the forty thousand that exist today.
Schultz later reflected on the significance of not taking no for an answer: "In the fifteen years since then, I have often wondered what would have happened had I just accepted his decision?" "So many times I've been told 'it can't be done.' Again and again, I've had to use every ounce of perseverance and persuasion I can summon to make things happen. Life is a series of near misses. But a lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all. It's seizing the day and accepting responsibility for your future. It's seeing what other people don't see, and pursuing that vision, no matter who tells you not to. In daily life, you get so much pressure from friends and family and colleagues, urging you to take the easy way, to follow the prevailing wisdom, that it can be difficult not to simply accept the status quo and do what's expected of you. But when you really believe—in yourself, in your dream—you just have to do everything you possibly can to take control and make your vision a reality."
If agency is acting without first seeking permission then perhaps we could say that "supreme agency" is continuing to act even after permission is sought but repeatedly and expressly denied.
Permissionless action is what gets the ball rolling but what will you do when the world inevitably starts doing everything it can to kick it off the field?
When the Starbucks founders later rejected Schultz's idea to serve espresso, he left to start his own coffee company.
When 217 investors turned down Schultz's idea for said new coffee company, he kept pitching until he raised his funding target.
When Schultz later tried to acquire Starbucks and one of his investors tried to beat him to the punch, he landed a meeting with Bill Gates Sr and convinced him to put up the money to win the bid.
Get started without permission, by all means, but at some point your permission will be actively denied. To make your ideas happen, you must act with supreme agency, figuring out how to press ahead even after you hit one roadblock after the next.

Here are some examples of good quotes:
 
"Once you succeed, people see only the success. If you fail, they see only the failure. Rarely do they see the turning points that could have taken you in a completely different direction. But it's at these inflection points that the most important lessons in business and life are learned."
 
"I think just learning from all the problems that come up. Like [as] you do these long races, inevitably there's problems that come up, and then you've experienced those problems, so then you have this filing cabinet in your brain where you can say—'here's all the things that I know of already that can go wrong.' If I'm, you know, puking in the bushes, I can open up a whole folder in this filing cabinet of times I've been throwing up during a race and the options that I have of what worked before or what I at least tried before. Remembering the evidence that this is something you have been through before helps you to keep pushing and know it will be fine."
 
"It's such a battle in your head, of trying to stay in the present moment—and hit this next shot good—and hit the next shot good. That was the battle today. My battle today was with myself. It wasn't with anyone else. You know, at the end there, it was with Justin, but my battle today was with my mind and staying in the present."
 
"All of the people who work in the kitchen with me go out into the forests and on to the beach. It's a part of their job. If you work with me you will often be starting your day in the forest or on the shore because I believe foraging will shape you as a chef. I know it has shaped me. If you see how a plant grows and you taste it in situ you have a perfect example of how it should taste on the plate. But it's more than that. When you get close to the raw materials and taste them at the moment they let go of the soil, you learn to respect them."
