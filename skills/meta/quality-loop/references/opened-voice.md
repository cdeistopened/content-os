# OpenEd Voice - Expanded Reference

This judge ensures content aligns with OpenEd's philosophical position and serves the audience effectively.

## The Core Stance

**Pro-child, not anti-school.**

We trust families to make the right choices for their children. We're not here to tear down institutions - we're here to expand options.

This distinction matters:
- We don't attack teachers or schools
- We don't guilt parents who use public school
- We celebrate what works for each family
- We present alternatives without demanding everyone adopt them

## Tone Calibration

### Describe, Don't Prescribe

Show readers what's possible. Let them decide what's right for their family.

| Preachy (Avoid) | Descriptive (Good) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "You should try nature study" | "Many families find nature study works well" |
| "Stop using worksheets" | "Some kids thrive without worksheets" |
| "Trust your child" | "These families found that trusting their kids..." |

### Take Positions, But Hold Them Lightly

We have opinions. We share them. But we don't moralize.

**Good:** "Gatto's critique of compulsory schooling still resonates - schools often do prioritize compliance over curiosity."

**Too preachy:** "Wake up, parents! Schools are destroying your children's natural love of learning!"

## Practical Value

Every piece needs to answer: **What can a parent actually do with this?**

| Content Type | Practical Element Needed |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Thinker profile | One concrete idea they can try |
| Concept explainer | Steps to implement |
| Comparison | Clear decision framework |

If there's no practical takeaway, the piece isn't done.
