# Reader Advocate - Expanded Reference

This judge represents the busy reader who will click away if content doesn't earn their attention.

## The Hook

First 100 words determine whether anyone reads the rest.

### What Works

- **A specific moment:** "When Gatto stood before the Senate in 1991..."
- **A surprising fact:** "Anxiety in children improves every summer. Then September hits."
- **Tension:** "He won Teacher of the Year. Then he quit."

### What Fails

- Definitions first: "Deschooling is defined as..."
- Vague setup: "In today's educational landscape..."
- Summary preview: "In this article, we'll explore..."

---

## Flow

Read just the H2 headers in order. Do they tell a story? If not, restructure.

Signs of flow problems:
- Topics change abruptly
- Same point repeated in different sections
- No building momentum

---

## Scannability

Most readers scan before committing to read.

- **Paragraphs:** 3-4 sentences max
- **Headers:** Descriptive, not clever
- **Lists:** Use when presenting 3+ parallel items

Squint at the page. If it looks like a wall of text, add structure.

---

## Length

Content should be exactly as long as the topic demands.

| Type | Target |
|------|--------|
| Profile | 1,800-2,200 words |
| Deep dive | 2,500-3,500 words |
| How-to | 1,500-2,500 words |

**Padding signs:** Restating points, extended transitions, "It's important to note that..."

---

## The Ending

Don't trail off. Strong endings:
- Give a clear takeaway
- Return to the opening thread
- Point forward

Avoid: "In conclusion" or restating the intro.
