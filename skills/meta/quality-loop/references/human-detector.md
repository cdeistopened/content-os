# Human Detector - Expanded Reference

The Human Detector is the most critical judge because AI tells are the hardest to catch and the most damaging to authenticity.

## The Correlative Construction (Priority #1)

This is THE most common AI tell. It appears in virtually all AI-generated content.

### Standard Form
```
"X isn't just Y - it's Z"
"Teachers aren't just instructors - they're mentors"
"Schools aren't just buildings - they're communities"
```

### Split-Sentence Form (Often Missed)
```
"X didn't emerge from Y alone. It came from Z."
"The method didn't emerge from theory. It came from practice."
"The goal isn't to remove all structure. It's to let structure emerge."
```

### Negation-Affirmation Form
```
"It's not about X, it's about Y"
"Success isn't about working harder. It's about working smarter."
```

### Detection Rule
If you see ANY construction that:
1. Sets up what something "isn't" or "didn't"
2. Then reveals what it "is" or "did"

It's a correlative construction. Rewrite it.

### Rewrites

**BAD:** "The Montessori method didn't emerge from theory alone. It came from a woman who understood..."

**GOOD:** "The Montessori method carries the fingerprints of a woman who understood..."

---

**BAD:** "The goal isn't to remove all structure. It's to let structure emerge from the child's interests."

**GOOD:** "Structure still exists - but it emerges from the child's genuine interests rather than adult-imposed requirements."

---

**BAD:** "Education isn't about filling buckets. It's about lighting fires."

**GOOD:** "Education lights fires."

---

## Triple Threat Syndrome

AI groups things in threes compulsively.

### Examples
- "Fast, efficient, reliable"
- "Bold, beautiful, brilliant"
- "Creative, curious, confident"

### Detection
When you see three adjectives in a row, ask: Would a human naturally group these? Usually not.

### Fix
Use two. Or four. Or rephrase entirely.

---

## Staccato Phrasing

Short. Choppy. Sentences. Like. This.

### Examples
- "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
- "Simple. Clear. Effective."
- "Big ideas. Small words. Maximum impact."

### Why It's a Tell
Real humans vary their sentence rhythm naturally. This forced pattern is distinctly AI.

### Fix
Write naturally. Vary sentence length without forcing a pattern.

---

## Dramatic Contrast Reveals (Priority #2)

AI loves punchy two-part contrasts that set up a negation then deliver a "reveal." This is a close cousin of correlative constructions but uses sentence fragments for dramatic effect.

### Examples
```
"Not on lessons. On fear."
"Not the curriculum. The structure."
"Not what they learned. What they unlearned."
"He didn't teach. He observed."
"Not reform. Revolution."
```

### Why It's a Tell
This pattern creates artificial drama through structure rather than content. It's a crutch AI uses to sound punchy and profound. Real writers earn drama through specificity, not syntax tricks.

### Detection Rule
If you see:
1. A short negation fragment ("Not X.")
2. Followed by a short affirmation fragment ("Y.")

It's a dramatic contrast reveal. Rewrite it.

### Rewrites

**BAD:** "Not on lessons. On fear."

**GOOD:** "He was taking notes on something else entirely - the fear he saw in students' eyes."

---

**BAD:** "He didn't teach. He observed."

**GOOD:** "He spent more time watching than talking."

---

**BAD:** "Not reform. Revolution."

**GOOD:** "He gave up on fixing schools and started helping families leave them."

---

### The Underlying Problem

These patterns substitute structure for substance. They make sentences feel important without adding meaning. A good test: Does the dramatic structure add information, or just emphasis? If just emphasis, flatten it into a normal sentence.

## Forbidden Vocabulary

These words appear constantly in AI output and rarely in human writing:

| AI Word | Human Alternative |
|---------|-------------------|
| delve | explore, look into |
| comprehensive | complete, full |
| crucial | important, key |
| vital | important, essential |
| leverage | use |
| landscape | field, area, space |
| navigate | handle, work through |
| foster | build, grow |
| facilitate | help, enable |
| realm | area, field |
| paradigm | approach, model |
| embark | start, begin |
| journey | process, path |
| tapestry | mix, blend |
| myriad | many, countless |
| multifaceted | complex, varied |
| seamless | smooth |
| cutting-edge | new, advanced |

### Detection Rule
If you see any of these words, replace with the simpler alternative.

---

## Forbidden Openers

Never start with:
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
- "Gone are the days when..."
- "It's no secret that..."
- "In an age where..."

### Why They're Tells
They're lazy setups that any AI produces. Humans start with specific details.

### Fix
Start with a specific fact, moment, or tension.

**BAD:** "In today's educational landscape, parents face unprecedented choices."

**GOOD:** "When Maria Montessori opened her first school in 1907, the children arrived unable to sit still."

---

## Hedging Language

AI hedges because uncertainty is safer. Humans with conviction state things directly.

### Examples
- "might" → "will" or "can"
- "could potentially" → "can"
- "it seems like" → [remove]
- "perhaps" → [remove or state directly]
- "Some experts say" → [cite specific expert]

### Detection
If removing the hedge doesn't change the meaning, remove it.

---

## Transition Overload

AI uses too many transition words trying to sound sophisticated.

### Overused Transitions
- Furthermore
- Moreover
- Additionally
- In addition
- It's important to note that
- It's worth mentioning that

### Fix
Strong structure needs fewer transitions. Use: but, and, so, then, because.

---

## Emotional Cliches Without Substance

### Examples
- "This will change your life" (without explaining how)
- "Game-changing" (for anything)
- "Revolutionary" (without evidence)
- "Life-changing" (generic)

### Fix
Replace with specific outcomes. What exactly changes? How? By how much?

---

## Empty Enthusiasm

AI overcompensates with hollow affirmations:

- "Absolutely!"
- "Great question!"
- "You're absolutely right!"
- "That's a fantastic point!"

These add nothing. Cut them.

---

## Authenticity Theater

Performative realness that signals fakeness:

- Overusing "real" ("real strategy from real experts getting real results")
- Forced relatability ("we've all been there")
- Fake vulnerability ("I'll be honest with you...")

If you have to announce authenticity, you've lost it.

---

## Short Hook Questions

Cheap engagement bait:

- "Want access?"
- "Ready to level up?"
- "Sound familiar?"
- "Curious?"

These are manipulation, not communication. Cut them.

---

## Punctuation Overload

AI loves dramatic punctuation:

- Excessive ellipses... for... emphasis...
- Multiple exclamation marks!!!
- Question marks for rhetorical effect??

Use punctuation normally. Drama comes from content, not punctuation.

---

## The Read-Aloud Test

After checking for patterns, read the piece aloud. Ask:
- Does this sound like someone talking?
- Would I be embarrassed to read this to a friend?
- Does any sentence feel "written by a robot"?

If yes to any, rewrite those sections.
