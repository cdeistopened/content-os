# Research & Idea Development

## Audience Research

Before writing, know exactly who you're speaking to.

**Key Questions**:
- What pains, desires, dreams, goals does this audience have?
- What do they already believe about this topic?
- What have they already heard/seen on this topic?

**AI Research Method**:
1. Find top 3 competitors in your niche
2. Extract transcripts from their top-performing videos (last 12 months)
3. Feed transcripts to Claude/ChatGPT
4. Ask: "What pain points does this audience have?" "What topics resonated?" "What beliefs do they hold?"

## Content Research: The Shock Score Method

**Goal**: Find facts that maximize the gap between what viewers know and what you'll tell them.

**Process**:
1. Consume source material (videos, articles, research, personal experience)
2. For each fact/insight, rate its Shock Score 1-100:
   - "Out of 100 viewers, how many would NOT have heard this before?"
   - 80+ = Must include (high shock)
   - 50-79 = Good supporting point
   - Below 50 = Skip unless essential context

**Where to Find High-Shock Facts**:
- Most-replayed sections of competitor videos (scrub timeline for peaks)
- Comments praising specific insights
- Academic research/studies
- Expert interviews
- Personal experience/experiments
- Contrarian takes on conventional wisdom

**Red Flags** (low shock, skip these):
- Information on first page of Google
- Advice repeated in every video on the topic
- Obvious common sense

## Keyword Research for SEO

**Tools**: VidIQ, TubeBuddy, YouTube Search Suggest

**Process**:
1. Type topic into YouTube search, note autocomplete suggestions
2. Check search volume and competition in VidIQ/TubeBuddy
3. Look for high-volume, low-competition phrases
4. Integrate target keyword into: Title, Description, Tags, Spoken hook

**Title Optimization**:
- Front-load the keyword
- Create curiosity gap
- Under 60 characters (doesn't get cut off)
