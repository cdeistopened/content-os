# Hook Formats

The hook has two jobs:
1. **Confirm the click** - Match expectations set by title/thumbnail
2. **Open a curiosity loop** - Create a question they must stay to answer

## The 9 Proven Hook Formats

### 1. Secret Reveal
Tease unknown insight or future implication.

> "Google just released four free AI trainings that make it way faster to learn AI."

**Best for**: News, product releases, tactical tips just uncovered

### 2. Case Study
Highlight a person/brand that achieved a result in an unexpected way.

> "Alex Hormozi just sold $100 million worth of books in 3 days using this five-step method."

**Best for**: Breaking down how X accomplished Y using Z method

### 3. Comparison
Compare two versions to illustrate optimal vs suboptimal.

> "What's the difference between a beginner creator and an experienced one?"

**Best for**: A vs B scenarios, before/after contrasts

### 4. Question
Ask a question to implant curiosity directly.

> "Can you bake sourdough bread in under an hour using only household ingredients?"

**Best for**: Challenge videos, addressing common viewer questions

### 5. Education
Introduce a step-by-step process.

> "Here's the easiest way to use ChatGPT to create content."

**Best for**: Tutorials, playbooks, how-to content

### 6. List
Introduce an ordered set of items.

> "These are the five best Premiere Pro editing templates that you can use for free."

### 7. Contrarian
Introduce a bold take that goes against the grain.

> "Jaguar's rebrand is one of the worst design blunders in the history of the world."

**Best for**: Opinion pieces, hot takes that spark discussion

### 8. Personal Experience
Introduce a personal story.

> "When I was in college, I used this sleep technique to only sleep 3 hours per night."

**Best for**: First-person storytelling, transformation narratives

### 9. Problem
Introduce a specific pain point to set up a solution.

> "If you struggle with acne, this is one obvious solution that will clear it right up."

**Best for**: Leading with pain, then delivering solution

## Hook Psychology: The PAS Framework

**P**roblem → **A**gitate → **S**olution (tease)

1. Call out a burning pain point
2. Stir emotion around the pain
3. Tease your unique solution

**Example**:
> "If you're struggling with how to write a viral YouTube script [PROBLEM] and you're feeling overwhelmed with where to even start [AGITATE], then I have some exciting news. I've discovered a simple seven-step framework that's helped me produce over 7 million views [SOLUTION TEASE]."

## Hook Psychology: The AIDA Framework

**A**ttention → **I**nterest → **D**esire → **D**elay

1. Burning question grabs attention
2. Tease unique solution to peak interest
3. Promise result to increase desire
4. Delay the solution to force continued watching

**Example**:
> "Have you ever wondered why plain boring thumbnails sometimes generate millions of views? [ATTENTION] You might have heard people say it's because it's simple. But what if I told you it's got nothing to do with simplicity—it's actually caused by something called a curiosity gap [INTEREST]. Once you understand how to create them, you'll notice a massive increase in your click-through rate [DESIRE]. But just before I reveal how it works, I want to start by explaining... [DELAY]"

## The 4 Hook Commandments

Before finalizing your hook, verify:

1. **Alignment**: Visual hook + spoken hook + text hook all match
2. **Speed to Value**: Value promised in first 3 seconds
3. **Clarity**: Topic is unmistakably clear
4. **Curiosity**: Opens a question viewer must answer

## Hook Formula (Universal)

**Target + Transformation + Stakes**

- **Target**: Who am I speaking to?
- **Transformation**: What will they learn/gain?
- **Stakes**: What happens if they don't watch?

Write these three components separately, then combine into a working hook.
