# Editing & Quality Audits

After your first draft, run these three audits before finalizing.

## 1. Story Flow Audit

**The Problem**: Too many tangents and unnecessary details break the viewer's hypnotic focus.

**The Test**: Read each line and ask:
> "Is this line a necessary step in the logical flow, or is it a distraction/tangent?"

**What to Look For**:
- Flashbacks or backstory that interrupt forward momentum
- Extra details that don't serve the main point
- "Red herrings" that confuse rather than clarify
- Broken plot lines (starting one thread, jumping to another, never returning)

**The Sidewalk Analogy**: Every unnecessary detail is like throwing a barrel at someone walking down a sidewalk. It forces them to jump, react, and break their stride.

**Fix**: Delete anything that breaks the through-line. Save it for another video.

**Quality Check**: Can a viewer follow from beginning to end without getting lost? Is there ONE clear thread?

## 2. Comprehension Audit

**The Problem**: Viewers don't understand what you're saying, so they leave.

**Goal**: Make viewers feel SMART, not dumb. Compress complex ideas into simple forms.

### 5 Comprehension Fixes

**1. Use simpler words**
- Target 6th grade vocabulary
- Claude/ChatGPT can rewrite at a simpler reading level in one click
- Big words only impress people who know them

**2. Use fewer words (shorter sentences)**
- Weak attention spans + limited working memory
- More words per sentence = more cognitive load
- Quick. Short. Punchy. Staccato.

**3. Use active voice**
- ✅ "The dog jumped"
- ❌ "The jumping was done by the dog"
- Active is clearer and more direct

**4. Restate twice**
- First time: Normal explanation
- Second time: Simplest possible version
- Example: "This is called rudimentary—or simple—logic."

**5. Name your frameworks**
- "Atomic Messaging" is easier to remember than "the practice of simplifying words for comprehension"
- A single-word label aids recall
- Make up names for your concepts

### Distillation

The skill of compressing complex ideas into simple language.

**Why it's hard for experts**: They have big vocabularies and forget what beginners don't know. The muscle is "dumbing yourself down"—and it's trainable.

## 3. Speed-to-Value Audit

**The Problem**: Viewers aren't getting a hit of value fast enough before they bounce.

**The Flow**:
```
Hook (0-3 sec): Signal incoming value
↓
First Body: Clear story flow
↓
Rehook (20-30 sec short-form, 2-3 min long-form): Re-trigger value
↓
Second Body: Clear story flow
↓
(Repeat rehook → body as needed)
↓
Outro: Summarize or extend value
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Value is mentioned/teased in first 3 seconds
- [ ] First body section delivers on that tease
- [ ] Rehooks happen at appropriate intervals
- [ ] Each section has its own mini-payoff
- [ ] Outro leaves viewer feeling satisfied OR hungry for more

## The Final Read-Through

After all three audits, read the entire script aloud.

**Ask yourself**:
1. Is this story interesting? (Would I keep watching?)
2. Is this as compressed as possible? (No fluff?)
3. Does this hook actually hook me? (Even on its own?)
4. What emotion do I feel when I finish? (Does it match my intended emotion?)

If any answer is unsatisfying, revise and repeat.

## Common Fixes Summary

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Story flow | Viewer gets lost | Delete tangents, maintain one thread |
| Comprehension | Viewer feels dumb | Simpler words, shorter sentences, restate |
| Speed to value | Viewer bounces early | Hook value in 3 sec, rehook often |
| Monotony | Viewer zones out | Vary pacing, examples, emotions |
| Weak ending | Low engagement | Binge loop, summarize value, CTA |
