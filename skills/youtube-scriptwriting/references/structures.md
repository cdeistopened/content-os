# Story Structures

Choose ONE structure that fits your content. Don't overcomplicate—pick what's already working in your niche.

## The 7 Proven Story Structures

### 1. Breakdown
Explain a complex concept in building blocks.

**Outline**:
```
Hook
↓
Initial Context + Shock
↓
Block 1: What happened / How it works
↓
Block 2: Why it matters
↓
Outro
```

**Best for**: Product launches, news, technology analysis
**Pair with hooks**: Secret Reveal, Question, Comparison, Contrarian

### 2. Newscaster
Factual recounting of an event (journalist style).

**Outline**:
```
Hook
↓
Full Context of Story
↓
(Optional) Brief Analysis/Take
↓
Outro
```

**Best for**: News coverage, journalism, updates
**Pair with hooks**: Secret Reveal, Question, Comparison, Contrarian, Problem

### 3. Case Study Explainer
Teach a framework/process that achieved an outcome.

**Outline**:
```
Hook
↓
Framework Piece 1
↓
Framework Piece 2
↓
Framework Piece 3-4
↓
Outro
```

**Best for**: Teaching skills, breaking down frameworks
**Pair with hooks**: Case Study, Question, Comparison

### 4. Listicle
Ordered list of items.

**Outline**:
```
Hook
↓
Item 1
↓
Item 2
↓
Item 3-5
↓
Outro
```

**Best for**: Mutually exclusive items that can stand alone
**Pair with hooks**: List, Problem

### 5. Problem-Solver
Agitate a pain, deliver a solution.

**Outline**:
```
Hook
↓
Problem (agitate)
↓
Solution
↓
Outro
```

**Best for**: Leading with pain, product/service content
**Pair with hooks**: Problem, Question, Contrarian

### 6. Tutorial
Step-by-step walkthrough of a system.

**Outline**:
```
Hook
↓
Step 1
↓
Step 2
↓
Step 3+
↓
Outro
```

**Best for**: How-to content, walkthroughs, experiments
**Pair with hooks**: Education, Question

**Note**: Tutorial steps are CONTINGENT (each builds on previous). Listicle items are INDEPENDENT (each stands alone).

### 7. Educational / Personal Story
First-person narrative with lessons.

**Outline**:
```
Hook
↓
Story Beginning
↓
Story Middle (conflict)
↓
Story End (resolution)
↓
Lesson/Takeaway

```

**Best for**: Motivation, inspiration, personal transformation
**Pair with hooks**: Personal Experience, Problem, Contrarian

## Choosing the Right Structure

1. **Look at what's working**: Study top videos in your niche. What structure do they use?
2. **Match to content type**:
   - Teaching a process → Tutorial or Case Study
   - Sharing a list of things → Listicle
   - Telling your story → Personal/Educational
   - Covering news → Newscaster or Breakdown
   - Solving a problem → Problem-Solver

## The "But-Therefore" Storytelling Method

Make stories engaging by using conflict transitions:

❌ Boring: "I did this. Then I did that. Then I did this."
✅ Engaging: "I did this. **But** then this happened. **Therefore** I had to do this."

"But" introduces conflict.
"Therefore" shows consequence.

**Example**:
> "I went on a walk. **But** it started raining. **Therefore** I started running back home."

## The 3A Story Framework

For any story segment:

1. **Beginning**: Set the scene, give context
2. **Challenge**: Introduce conflict (the "but")
3. **Consequence**: Show what happened as a result (the "therefore")

This creates tension and resolution in every section, not just the overall video.
