## The 5 Core Techniques

### 1. Alliteration
### 2. Symmetry
### 3. Contrast
### 4. Rhyme
### 5. Rhythm

---

## Technique 1: Alliteration

### Definition
Using words that start with the same sound in close succession

### Why It Works
- Creates pleasing sound pattern
- Easier to remember (brain likes patterns)
- Adds emphasis and rhythm
- Feels intentional and crafted

### Examples

**General:**
- "Specificity is the secret." - @ItsKieranDrew
- "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed." - Naval Ravikant
- "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Steve Jobs
- "Slip and stick."
- "Make writing the medium. Make exploration the habit."

**Education/OpenEd:**
- "Permission beats perfectionism."
- "Curiosity creates community."
- "Learning through living, not lectures."
- "Freedom over frameworks."
- "Structure supports, it doesn't suffocate."
- "Play precedes progress."
- "Mastery matters more than motion."

### Formula
```
[S-word] is the [S-word]
[P-word] [P-word] [P-word]
[Word] beats [similar-sound-word]
```

### How to Create

**Step 1:** Identify your core message
Example: "Being specific helps"

**Step 2:** Find synonyms starting with same letter
- Specific → specificity
- Helps → secret, solution, superpower

**Step 3:** Combine for impact
Result: "Specificity is the secret"

**Practice Exercise:**
Take these concepts and make them alliterative:
- "Freedom is important" → "Freedom over formality"
- "Kids need community" → "Community creates connection"
- "Questions help learning" → "Questions unlock curiosity"

---

## Technique 2: Symmetry

### Definition
Creating balance in sentence structure through parallel phrases

### Why It Works
- Creates satisfying rhythm
- Emphasizes contrast or connection
- Easier to remember (pattern matching)
- Feels complete and authoritative

### Examples

**General:**
- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations." - Naval Ravikant
- "Make writing the medium. Make exploration the habit."
- "A lack of negatives outweighs an abundance of positives."
- "Design for function. Build for beauty."

**Education/OpenEd:**
- "Teach for understanding. Test for mastery."
- "School measures time. Education measures learning."
- "Traditional schools teach subjects. Microschools teach students."
- "Public schools optimize for compliance. Open education optimizes for curiosity."
- "Credentials signal past learning. Skills signal current capability."
- "Grade levels group by age. Mastery groups by readiness."

### Formula

**Pattern A: [Action 1] for [outcome]. [Action 2] for [outcome].**
- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "Learn for knowledge. Create for impact."

**Pattern B: It's not [X]. It's [Y].**
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations."
- "It's not grade levels. It's learning progressions."

**Pattern C: [Noun 1] [verb] [object]. [Noun 2] [verb] [object].**
- "School measures time. Education measures learning."
- "Teachers deliver content. Guides facilitate discovery."

### How to Create

**Step 1:** Identify two related concepts
Example: "School vs Education"

**Step 2:** Find parallel structures
- Both can "measure" something
- School measures → time, compliance, seat hours
- Education measures → learning, growth, mastery

**Step 3:** Create balance
Result: "School measures time. Education measures learning."

**Practice Exercise:**
Create symmetrical sentences for:
- Traditional learning vs Open learning
- Credentials vs Skills
- Homework vs Projects

---

## Technique 3: Contrast

### Definition
Juxtaposing opposing ideas to create impact

### Why It Works
- Highlights extremes
- Forces binary choice
- Creates tension and resolution
- Memorable because of stark difference

### Examples

**General:**
- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere." - Letters from a Stoic
- "Your simple guide to massive money."
- "Be clear, not clever. Concise, not complex." - @ItsKieranDrew
- "Strong opinions, loosely held."
- "Think big. Start small."

**Education/OpenEd:**
- "Small schools. Big difference."
- "Less structure, more learning."
- "Simple plan. Profound results."
- "Short days. Deep work."
- "One teacher, eight students. Not one teacher, thirty students."
- "Fewer rules, better behavior."
- "No grades, real feedback."

### Formula

**Pattern A: [Adjective 1], not [Adjective 2]**
- "Clear, not clever"
- "Simple, not simplistic"
- "Open, not chaotic"

**Pattern B: [Small thing]. [Big impact].**
- "Small schools. Big difference."
- "One decision. Everything changes."

**Pattern C: [A] to [extreme]. [B] to [opposite extreme].**
- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere."
- "To teach everything is to teach nothing."

### How to Create

**Step 1:** Identify your point
Example: "Microschools are small but impactful"

**Step 2:** Find opposing descriptors
- Small ↔ Big
- Few ↔ Many
- Simple ↔ Complex

**Step 3:** Create tension
Result: "Small schools. Big difference."

**Practice Exercise:**
Create contrasts for:
- Homeschooling flexibility vs traditional rigidity
- Mastery-based (slow) vs time-based (fast)
- Credentials (old) vs skills (new)

## Technique 4: Rhyme

### Definition
Using words with similar ending sounds

### Why It Works

- "Tell a story or lose your glory"
- "Teach real skills or drill for tests"

**Pattern B: [Concept], [rhyming concept]**
- "Community creates unity"
- "Curiosity before ability"

### How to Create

**Step 1:** Identify core message
Example: "Community is important"

**Step 2:** Find rhyming words related to message
- Community → unity, opportunity
- Important → alignment, excitement

**Step 3:** Craft sentence
Result: "Build community, create unity."

**Warning:** Easy to sound cheesy. Use sparingly and ensure it adds value, not just rhymes.

**Practice Exercise:**
Create rhymes for:
- Mastery-based learning
- Letting kids play
- Following curiosity

## Technique 5: Rhythm

### Definition
Creating a pleasing cadence in your sentence through word choice and structure

### Why It Works

- Stands out from normal prose

### Examples

**General:**
- "When you can't wait to share it, they can't help but read it."

- "Mornings for mastery. Afternoons for discovery."

### Formula

**Pattern A: Short. Punchy. Fragments.**
- "Small groups. Deep learning. Real relationships."
- "No grades. No tests. No limits."

**Pattern B: [The more X, the more Y]**
- "The more you learn, the more you earn."
- "The less you plan, the more they explore."

**Pattern C: [Action A]. [Action B]. [Result].**
- "Find their interests. Fuel their fire. Watch them flourish."
- "Build community. Trust the process. See transformation."

### How to Create

**Step 1:** List your key points
Example:
- Kids have interests
- Parents should support those interests
- Results in passionate learning

**Step 2:** Use short, similar-length phrases
- Find → Fuel → Watch (parallel verbs)
- Their interests → their fire → them flourish (similar structure)

**Step 3:** Test it aloud
Result: "Find their interests. Fuel their fire. Watch them flourish."

**Practice Exercise:**
Create rhythmic sentences for:
- Microschool benefits (list 3)
- Unschooling philosophy
- Why credentials don't matter

## Combining Techniques

### Symmetry + Contrast
"School measures time. Education measures learning."

### Alliteration + Rhythm
"The M.A.N stack is motivation in minutes."

### All 5 Combined (Rare but Powerful)
"Read to learn. Write to think. Teach to master."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Forcing it** - If it doesn't flow naturally, it won't sound good
❌ **Sacrificing clarity for style** - Sticky means nothing if the meaning is unclear
❌ **Overusing rhyme** - Can sound childish or forced
❌ **Being too clever** - Remember: "Be clear, not clever"
❌ **Using all techniques at once** - Usually 1-2 is most powerful

## Quality Checklist for Sticky Sentences

Test your sentence:

- [ ] **Can I remember it 5 minutes later?** (Memory test)
- [ ] **Would I quote this to a friend?** (Quotability test)
- [ ] **Does it sound good read aloud?** (Rhythm test)
