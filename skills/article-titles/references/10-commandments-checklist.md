# 10 Commandments of Engagement Checklist

A systematic checklist for optimizing hooks and headlines based on proven psychological principles.

## How to Use This Checklist

**Purpose:** Evaluate and improve your top 5-7 hook variations before final selection

**Workflow:**
1. Generate 10+ hook variations (Phase 2 of main skill)
2. Select top 5-7 based on frameworks used
3. Run each through this checklist
4. Score: Count how many commandments each hook applies (aim for 4-6)
5. Optimize: Add missing commandments where natural
6. Select: Choose hook with highest score + best fit

**Important:** You don't need all 10 in every hook. Aim for 4-6. More than 7 risks feeling manipulative.

## The 10 Commandments

### 1. Numbers and Statistics
### 2. Negativity Bias
### 3. Pattern Interrupt
### 4. Target Callout
### 5. Problem Callout
### 6. Confidence and Conviction
### 7. Aesthetics
### 8. Potential Benefit
### 9. Social Proof
### 10. Warning and Caution

---

## Commandment 1: Numbers and Statistics

### Principle
Use specific numbers to add credibility and reduce vagueness

### Why It Works
- Brain processes numbers faster than words
- Specificity implies accuracy and research
- Concrete vs abstract (easier to visualize)
- Creates curiosity ("Why that specific number?")

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook include a specific number?
- [ ] Are percentages, dollar amounts, or timeframes included?
- [ ] Have I avoided vague words like "many," "some," "lots"?
- [ ] Is the number realistic and accurate?

### Examples

**Without numbers:**
- "Many students are enrolled in microschools now"
- "Lots of people are making this mistake"
- "Save time with these tips"

**With numbers:**
- "1.5 million students are enrolled in microschools now"
- "90% of new homeschoolers make this mistake"
- "Save 100+ hours with these 7 tips"

### Types of Numbers to Use
- Percentages: "76% satisfaction rate"
- Dollar amounts: "$12,000 saved per year"
- Timeframes: "In 90 days"
- Quantities: "7 strategies"
- Specific results: "From 100 to 10,000 followers"
- Ratios: "1 teacher, 8 students"

### When to Skip
- Number would be misleading or inaccurate
- Context is purely qualitative
- Too many numbers create clutter

---

## Commandment 2: Negativity Bias

### Principle
Highlight potential losses, mistakes, or negative consequences

### Why It Works
- Humans are wired to avoid loss more than seek gain
- Fear of missing out (FOMO) is powerful motivator
- Mistakes are more memorable than successes
- Creates urgency ("I need to fix this")

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook warn of a potential loss?
- [ ] Are consequences of inaction clear?
- [ ] Does it identify what reader might be missing?
- [ ] Is the fear legitimate (not manipulative)?

### Examples

**Positive framing only:**
- "How to succeed at homeschooling"
- "Great tips for learning"
- "Build a better school"

**Negativity bias applied:**
- "The costly mistake 90% of homeschoolers make"
- "What you're missing about mastery-based learning"
- "Stop doing this before it ruins your microschool"

### Ways to Apply
- **Mistake focus:** "Are you making this [X] mistake?"
- **Loss aversion:** "What [inaction] is costing you"
- **Warning:** "Before you [action], read this"
- **Missing out:** "What [group] doesn't want you to know"
- **Consequence:** "Why [common practice] is killing [goal]"

### When to Skip
- Content is purely inspirational
- Audience is already anxious (don't add more fear)
- Loss framing would be manipulative

### Balance with Positivity
Don't make everything negative. Best hooks often pair:
- Negative hook + positive solution
- "Stop [problem]. Start [solution]."

---

## Commandment 3: Pattern Interrupt

### Principle
Challenge common beliefs, practices, or expectations

### Why It Works
- Breaks through scrolling/scanning autopilot
- Creates cognitive dissonance ("Wait, what?")
- Signals non-obvious content
- Makes reader pause and reconsider

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook challenge a common assumption?
- [ ] Would it make someone stop mid-scroll?
- [ ] Is it surprising or counterintuitive?
- [ ] Does it contradict conventional wisdom?

### Examples

**Expected/conventional:**
- "Why you should plan your homeschool year"
- "How to teach your kids effectively"
- "The importance of credentials"

**Pattern interrupt:**
- "Forget everything you know about grade levels"
- "The less you plan, the more they learn"
- "Why the best microschool founders have zero teaching credentials"

### Ways to Apply
- **Forget everything:** "Forget what you know about [topic]"
- **Opposite claim:** "The less [X], the more [Y]"
- **Surprising stat:** "98% don't know [surprising fact]"
- **Challenge authority:** "[Experts] are wrong about [topic]"
- **Reverse conventional wisdom:** "Why [common practice] actually hurts"

### Types of Pattern Interrupts

**1. Reversal:**
"The less curriculum you buy, the more they learn"

**2. Negation:**
"Stop measuring seat time. Start measuring mastery."

**3. Paradox:**
"The hardest path is often the easiest"

**4. Contradiction:**
"My kid became homecoming queen attending school 2 hours a day"

### When to Skip
- Content doesn't actually challenge assumptions
- You're being contrarian just for attention
- The interrupt would confuse rather than intrigue

---

## Commandment 4: Target Callout

### Principle
Directly address your specific audience by name or situation

### Why It Works
- Immediate self-selection ("This is for me")
- Increases relevance perception
- Cuts through noise for niche audiences
- Shows you understand them specifically

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook name the target audience?
- [ ] Would readers immediately know if it's for them?
- [ ] Is the audience specific (not just "parents" or "people")?
- [ ] Does it reference their unique context?

### Examples

**Generic audience:**
- "Tips for better learning"
- "How to start a school"
- "Advice for parents"

**Target callout:**
- "Homeschool parents: Stop replicating public school at home"
- "Burned-out teachers: Here's your exit plan"
- "For parents considering alternatives to public school:"

### Ways to Apply

**1. Direct address:**
"[Audience name]: [Message]"
- "Digital nomad families: The microschool models that travel"

**2. Situation callout:**
"If you're [specific situation], [message]"
- "If your kid begs not to go to school, read this"

**3. Pain point specificity:**
"For [audience] struggling with [specific problem]"
- "For homeschoolers drowning in curriculum choices"

**4. Identity-based:**
"[Role/identity] need to know this:"
- "Public school principals who homeschool their own kids"

### Levels of Specificity

**Too broad:**
- "Parents" (which parents?)
- "Teachers" (what kind? what context?)

**Good:**
- "Homeschool parents"
- "First-year teachers"

**Very specific (often best):**
- "New homeschool parents in their first 90 days"
- "Burned-out public school teachers considering alternatives"

### When to Skip
- Content applies to everyone equally
- Being too specific would exclude valuable readers
- Platform/context makes audience obvious

---

## Commandment 5: Problem Callout

### Principle
Identify the specific pain point, struggle, or obstacle immediately

### Why It Works
- Shows you understand their struggle
- Creates instant relatability
- Signals relevant solution incoming
- Pain is more motivating than gain initially

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook name a specific problem?
- [ ] Would readers recognize this pain point?
- [ ] Is it concrete (not vague like "doing better")?
- [ ] Does it tap into real frustration?

### Examples

**Vague or no problem:**
- "Tips for homeschooling"
- "How to improve learning"
- "Better education approaches"

**Problem callout:**
- "Tired of your kid begging not to go to school?"
- "Drowning in curriculum you never use?"
- "Spending $15K/year and your kid still hates learning?"

### Ways to Apply

**1. Question format:**
"Tired of [specific problem]?"
- "Tired of homework battles every night?"

**2. Pain statement:**
"[Problem] is killing [goal]"
- "Over-planning is killing your kid's curiosity"

**3. Struggle acknowledgment:**
"Struggling with [specific issue]?"
- "Struggling to find community for your homeschooler?"

**4. Frustration naming:**
"The frustrating truth about [problem]"
- "The frustrating truth about 'learning gaps'"

### Problem Specificity Levels

**Too vague:**
- "Having trouble?"
- "Need help?"

**Good:**
- "Struggling with math?"
- "Homework battles?"

**Very specific (often best):**
- "Spending 3 hours on math homework for a 20-minute lesson?"
- "Your 5th grader reads at '3rd grade level' but devours 500-page novels?"

### Problem + Solution Pattern
Best hooks name problem, then promise solution:
- "Drowning in curriculum? Here's the simple filter I use:"
- "Kids hate school? This changed everything:"

### When to Skip
- Content is aspirational/inspirational (not problem-focused)
- Problem would be offensive or insensitive
- Audience doesn't identify with having a "problem"

---

## Commandment 6: Confidence and Conviction

### Principle
Use strong, assertive language; eliminate hedge words

### Why It Works
- Confidence is persuasive
- Certainty reduces decision friction
- Hedge words signal doubt
- Reader wants decisive guidance, not maybes

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Have I eliminated hedge words (maybe, might, could, possibly)?
- [ ] Do I speak in absolutes when accurate?
- [ ] Is the language assertive, not tentative?
- [ ] Would I say this with confidence to a friend?

### Examples

**Hedging/uncertain:**
- "This might help you homeschool better"
- "Possibly the best approach"
- "Could be useful for learning"
- "I think maybe this works"

**Confident/convicted:**
- "This is how to homeschool successfully"
- "The best approach for mastery learning"
- "Use this for breakthrough results"
- "This works. Here's why:"

### Hedge Words to Eliminate

**Remove these:**
- Maybe, might, could, possibly, probably, perhaps
- I think, I believe, in my opinion (when unnecessary)
- Sort of, kind of, somewhat, fairly
- Try to, attempt to (just say "do")

**Replace with:**
- Is, will, does, works
- This is how, here's why, the truth is
- Simply, just, exactly

### Conviction Techniques

**1. Speak in absolutes (when accurate):**
- Not: "This could increase learning"
- But: "This increases learning"

**2. Use declarative statements:**
- Not: "I think grade levels might not matter"
- But: "Grade levels don't matter. Here's what does:"

**3. Command/imperative voice:**
- Not: "You might want to try..."
- But: "Do this:"

**4. Remove qualifiers:**
- Not: "This is a relatively simple approach"
- But: "This is simple"

### When to Add Nuance
- Legal/medical topics requiring disclaimers
- Complex topics needing context
- When absolute claim would be dishonest

### Confidence ≠ Arrogance
**Confident:** "This is the system that works"
**Arrogant:** "This is the only system that works, everyone else is wrong"

---

## Commandment 7: Aesthetics

### Principle
Ensure visual appeal and readability

### Why It Works
- Visual processing happens before reading
- Clean formatting signals quality
- Scannable structure invites reading
- Wall of text triggers avoidance

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Is the hook visually clean?
- [ ] Are line breaks in the right places?
- [ ] Does it look easy to read at a glance?
- [ ] Would I stop scrolling based on how this looks?

### Examples

**Poor aesthetics:**
```
I've spent 10 years homeschooling four kids and I've learned so much about what works and what doesn't work and I want to share the top 7 strategies that actually made a difference in our homeschool journey.
```
(Wall of text, no breaks, one sentence)

**Good aesthetics:**
```
10 years homeschooling four kids.

Here are the 7 strategies that actually worked:
```
(Short lines, clear breaks, scannable)

### Formatting Rules

**For Social Media Hooks (X, LinkedIn, Facebook):**

1. **First line must be short** (5-12 words ideal)
2. **Use line breaks between sentences**
3. **Max 3 sentences for hook**
4. **Avoid ALL CAPS** (except strategic emphasis)
5. **Use emojis sparingly** (1-2 max, if at all)

**For Newsletter Subject Lines:**

1. **35-50 characters ideal** (mobile preview)
2. **No line breaks** (won't work in subject lines)
3. **Clear even when truncated**

**For Headlines:**

1. **One line when possible**
2. **Use title case or sentence case consistently**
3. **Avoid punctuation clusters** (!!!, ???)

### Visual Hierarchy

**Good pattern:**
```
[Short hook line]

[Context sentence]

[Promise/benefit]
```

**Bad pattern:**
```
[Everything crammed together without breaks and no visual hierarchy making it hard to scan or know where to focus attention]
```

### Whitespace Matters
More whitespace = easier to read = higher engagement

**Compare:**

Cramped:
```
10 years teaching. 5 microschools. 150 students. Here's what worked:
```

Spacious:
```
10 years teaching.
5 microschools.
150 students.

Here's what worked:
```

The spacious version performs better on social media.

### Platform-Specific Aesthetics

**X/Twitter:**
- Very short first line (hook)
- Generous line breaks
- Emoji at end of thread signal (🧵)

**LinkedIn:**
- First 2 lines show in feed (must work standalone)
- Professional formatting
- Line breaks for readability

**Facebook:**
- Can be denser (platform shows more)
- Questions work well
- Image + text combo ideal

### When to Skip
Subject lines and contexts where formatting doesn't display (plain text email, etc.)

---

## Commandment 8: Potential Benefit

### Principle
Clearly state what the reader will gain

### Why It Works
- Answers "What's in it for me?" immediately
- Reduces uncertainty about value
- Benefit > Feature (people care about outcomes)
- Clear ROI compels click

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Is the benefit crystal clear?
- [ ] Does it focus on outcome, not just process?
- [ ] Can reader visualize their life after?
- [ ] Is benefit specific and tangible?

### Examples

**Unclear/no benefit:**
- "Things about homeschooling"
- "Microschool information"
- "Learning strategies"

**Clear benefit:**
- "How to cut homeschool costs by $10,000/year"
- "The system that ended our homework battles forever"
- "7 tools that gave me 10 hours back per week"

### Benefit Types

**1. Time saved:**
- "Save 100 hours of research"
- "Cut planning time in half"

**2. Money saved/earned:**
- "Save $12,000/year"
- "How I earn $3K/month with 8 students"

**3. Problem solved:**
- "End homework battles"
- "Finally find community"

**4. Outcome achieved:**
- "Kids who actually love learning"
- "From hating school to asking for more"

**5. Stress reduced:**
- "Stop feeling overwhelmed"
- "The guilt-free approach"

**6. Transformation:**
- "From burned out to thriving"
- "Struggling reader to bookworm"

### Feature → Benefit Translation

**Feature:** "Mastery-based curriculum"
**Benefit:** "Your kid never moves on until they actually understand"

**Feature:** "Small class sizes"
**Benefit:** "Your kid gets help the moment they're stuck"

**Feature:** "Flexible schedule"
**Benefit:** "Family vacation in October, no problem"

### Specificity Levels

**Vague benefit:**
- "Better learning"
- "Improved results"
- "More success"

**Specific benefit:**
- "Reads 2 grade levels up in 6 months"
- "From tantrum to independently working for 2 hours"
- "College acceptance with no traditional transcript"

### When to Skip
- Benefit is so obvious it's redundant
- Content is entertaining (not utility-focused)
- Audience reads for identity/philosophy (not outcomes)

---

## Commandment 9: Social Proof

### Principle
Leverage authority, popularity, or third-party validation

### Why It Works
- Reduces risk perception
- Borrowed credibility
- "If it worked for them..." (vicarious success)
- Authority shortcut to trust

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook reference credible authority?
- [ ] Are results/credentials mentioned?
- [ ] Is third-party validation included?
- [ ] Would this build trust with skeptical reader?

### Examples

**No social proof:**
- "How to grow a microschool"
- "Tips for homeschooling"
- "Learning strategies that work"

**With social proof:**
- "How Kelly Smith grew Prenda to 10,000 students"
- "The system 1,000+ homeschoolers use"
- "Backed by 20 years of research"

### Types of Social Proof

**1. Authority credentials:**
- "15 years teaching experience"
- "Former public school principal"
- "PhD in education"

**2. Results achieved:**
- "Grew from 5 to 150 students"
- "Saved $12,000 per year"
- "6 kids, all successful (none went to college)"

**3. Scale/popularity:**
- "Used by 10,000+ families"
- "Trusted by 500+ microschool founders"
- "1.5 million students enrolled"

**4. Third-party validation:**
- "Featured in The New York Times"
- "Backed by Stanford research"
- "Recommended by HSLDA"

**5. Expert endorsement:**
- "Peter Thiel's approach to education"
- "What Naval Ravikant says about credentials"
- "Kerry McDonald's method"

**6. User results:**
- "How @username went from X to Y"
- "The system that worked for [name]"

### When to Include

**Include when:**
- You have relevant credentials/results
- Borrowing authority from respected figure
- Scale adds legitimacy
- Results are impressive and relevant

**Skip when:**
- Would feel like bragging
- Credentials aren't relevant
- No meaningful social proof to share
- Audience doesn't care about authority

### Bragging vs Authority

**Authority (good):**
"10 years homeschooling. Here's what worked:"

**Bragging (bad):**
"I'm the best homeschooler ever. Let me tell you why:"

### Combining Social Proof Types

"How Kelly Smith (founder of Prenda) grew from 7 kids around a kitchen table to 10,000 students across 1,000+ schools"

This combines:
- Authority (founder)
- Results (7 → 10,000)
- Scale (1,000+ schools)

---

## Commandment 10: Warning and Caution

### Principle
Create sense of urgency or importance through warning

### Why It Works
- Signals critical information
- Creates FOMO (fear of missing out)
- Implies reader might be at risk
- Urgency compels immediate action

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does it suggest reader might be missing something?
- [ ] Is there time sensitivity or urgency?
- [ ] Does it warn of potential pitfall?
- [ ] Would it make someone prioritize reading this?

### Examples

**No urgency:**
- "Tips for homeschooling"
- "How microschools work"
- "Information about learning"

**Warning/urgency:**
- "Before you buy curriculum, read this"
- "The mistake that costs homeschoolers $1,000s"
- "Warning: This common practice is killing curiosity"

### Ways to Apply

**1. "Before you..." format:**
- "Before you join a microschool, ask these 3 questions"
- "Before you start homeschooling, read this"

**2. "Warning:" prefix:**
- "Warning: This common homeschool mistake costs years"
- "Warning: Not all microschools are created equal"

**3. Time urgency:**
- "Applications close November 10"
- "This is changing fast"
- "Don't wait until [consequence]"

**4. Consequence framing:**
- "What [inaction] is costing you"
- "The hidden cost of [common practice]"

**5. Mistake prevention:**
- "The costly mistake 90% make"
- "Avoid these 3 pitfalls"
- "Don't make the mistake I did"

### Types of Urgency

**1. Time-based:**
"Applications close November 10"

**2. Consequence-based:**
"Every day in the wrong school costs your kid's love of learning"

**3. Opportunity-based:**
"Spots are filling fast"

**4. Information-based:**
"What you don't know about [topic] is hurting you"

### When to Use

**Use when:**
- There IS genuine urgency
- Consequence of delay is real
- Want to move reader from awareness to action
- Information is time-sensitive

**Don't use when:**
- Creating false urgency
- Content is evergreen/not time-sensitive
- Would feel manipulative
- Audience is already anxious (don't add more pressure)

### Ethical Guidelines

**Real urgency:** "Applications close November 10" ✅
**False urgency:** "Read this NOW or fail forever" ❌

**Helpful warning:** "Before you buy, here's what to know" ✅
**Manipulative:** "If you don't do this, you're a bad parent" ❌

---

## Scoring Your Hooks

### How to Score

For each hook variation, count how many commandments apply:

**10/10:** Probably overkill, may feel manipulative
**7-9/10:** Very strong, high engagement likely
**4-6/10:** Good, aim for this range
**2-3/10:** Weak, needs optimization
**0-1/10:** Generic, start over

### Example Scoring

**Hook:** "1.5 million students are in microschools now. Here's the surprising truth about why they work:"

Commandments applied:
1. ✅ Numbers (1.5 million)
2. ❌ Negativity bias
3. ✅ Pattern interrupt ("surprising truth")
4. ❌ Target callout
5. ❌ Problem callout
6. ✅ Confidence ("Here's")
7. ✅ Aesthetics (clean, short)
8. ✅ Benefit (will learn "why they work")
9. ✅ Social proof (scale = 1.5M)
10. ❌ Warning

**Score: 6/10** - Strong hook

### Optimization Strategy

If score is 3 or below, ask:
1. Can I add a specific number?
2. Can I name the target audience?
3. Can I make the benefit clearer?
4. Can I add urgency/warning?

Don't force all 10. Natural application > checklist completion.

---

## Common Combinations

Some commandments naturally pair well:

**Target + Problem:**
"Homeschool parents: Tired of curriculum overwhelm?"

**Numbers + Social Proof:**
"1,000+ families use this system"

**Warning + Benefit:**
"Before you buy curriculum (save yourself $1,000)"

**Confidence + Pattern Interrupt:**
"Forget everything you know. Here's what actually works:"

**Negativity + Solution:**
"Stop making this mistake. Do this instead:"

---

## Platform-Specific Applications

### X/Twitter Hooks
**Prioritize:** Numbers, Pattern Interrupt, Confidence, Aesthetics
**Often skip:** Target callout (if audience is already niche)

### LinkedIn Hooks
**Prioritize:** Social Proof, Confidence, Benefit, Target Callout
**Often skip:** Warning/urgency (unless B2B relevant)

### Newsletter Subject Lines
**Prioritize:** Numbers, Benefit, Curiosity (pattern interrupt), Warning
**Often skip:** Aesthetics (no formatting), Social Proof (less space)

### Facebook Hooks
**Prioritize:** Problem, Target, Benefit, Aesthetics
**Often skip:** Formal social proof (casual platform)
