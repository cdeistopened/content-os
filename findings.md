# Content OS - Findings

---

## Core Insight

**The product is not 30 skills. It's one configurable writing engine.**

Content OS = Voice Layer + Framework Layer + Format Layer

Everything else is either:
- Baked into the engine (anti-AI patterns, humanization)
- A supporting tool (image generation, transcription)
- Cut entirely (vendor-locked, too specific)

---

## Architecture

### Voice Layer (capture once)
User provides 3-5 writing samples. System extracts:
- Sentence rhythm and length patterns
- Word choice preferences
- Structural habits
- What they avoid

### Framework Layer (templates/structures)
Proven formulas for different content types:
- Hook patterns (cold opens, paradox hooks, story hooks)
- Body structures (listicles, narratives, how-tos)
- Closing patterns (CTAs, cliffhangers, callbacks)

### Format Layer (outputs)
- Newsletter
- Twitter/X thread
- LinkedIn post
- Blog article
- Video script
- Carousel slides

## What Gets Absorbed Into the Engine

These existing skills become FEATURES, not separate tools:
- human-writing, anti-ai-writing, ghostwriter → core output quality
- voice-wizard, voice-analyzer → voice capture workflow
- text-content templates → framework library
- newsletter-to-social → format conversion

---

## What Stays Separate

| Tool | Why Separate |
|------|--------------|
| skill-creator | Meta tool for extending system |
| nano-banana-image-generator | Different domain (visual) |
| local-markdown-search | Utility (search/retrieval) |
| transcription tools | Input processing |

---

## What Gets Cut

- All OpenEd-specific skills
- All vendor-locked skills (Notion, HubSpot)
- All wiki/research pipeline skills
- Specific voice clones (voice-pirate-wires, etc.)
